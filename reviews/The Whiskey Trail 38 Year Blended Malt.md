**The Whiskey Trail 38 Year Blended Malt / 45.9% / ~$250**

*Tasted neat*

[This blended malt](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/168949/blended-scotch-whisky-1980-eld) was distilled in 1980 (before I existed) and was bottled in 2019 from Sherry Butt #18 to yield a whopping 528 bottles.  I picked it up because I couldn't pass up even a blend older than I am.

* **Color:** old oak (1.8)
* **Nose:** soft, buttery sherry, vanilla, linseed oil, and pipe smoke
* **Taste:** layered sherry, beer jerky, tannins, stewed berries, and mint
* **Finish:** medium; sweetness and some oak

This is something I picked up for a lark, and it's probably a pretty good age-to-value proposition.  You definitely feel the age on the cask, it's intensely woody, super-aged cognac hints of french oak and mint.

**Rating: 90/100**
