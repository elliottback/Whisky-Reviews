**Laphroaig 10 / 43% ABV**

*Tasted neat, then with bottled water*

I've never reviewed this dram before, and my bottle is nearly done, so here's quick side-by-side with it's older brother.  Note: I like Laphroaig, especially the 10 CS and Triple Wood!

* **Color:** amber
* **Nose:** phenolic peat, iodine, and cream; quite antiseptic
* **Taste:** rubbery oak and smoked jam; menthol
* **Finish:** honeyed lozenges--hey it's flu season!

Laphroaig 10 is a great Islay intro dram, but it's sloppily structured--it has the right elements, but it's been overmellowed.  Compared to Ardbeg 10's clean lines, or the Laphroaig QC or other more matured releases, it lacks youth or stately depth.  At cask strength, it's better; at 43% it's a little wimpy.

Rating: 86/100

**Laphroaig 18 / 48% ABV / $90**

*Tasted neat, then with bottled water*

Texacer got mad at me for saying I didn't like the 18 some weeks ago... but I've found myself getting more into it over time.  This is the first time I've tried a bottle, which I picked up in Phoenix AZ (the west coast has amazing scotch prices, too bad I wasn't in Cali).  It has grown on me.

* **Color:** amber, *exactly* the same color as the 10 so it's probably caramel E150
* **Nose:** subdued; honey, leather, heather, and brine
* **Taste:** red wine-like tannins and brambleberry, vanilla, some peat smoke
* **Finish:** slow spreading warmth, ice cream

I appreciate Laphroaig 18's higher ABV; it's a solid dram worth trying.  Probably not on my "buy regularly" list, but if it went on sale I'd snag a bottle.
