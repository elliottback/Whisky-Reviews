**Craigellachie 2003 SMWS 44.110 / 59.5% / Â¥13,000**

*Tasted neat, then with some filtered water*

[This Craigellachie](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/140368/craigellachie-2003-smws-44110) "Treasure Trove" is a 15 year old aged in a new oak hogshead, distilled 27 June 2003, and one of 317 bottles.  It promises:

    A boozy berry sauce was followed by a Muscat wine.
    Water opened up a treasure trove of aromas.
    Previously matured in an ex-bourbon hogshead.

Hang on--*previously matured*--so this is yet another cask finish, this time in virgin oak.  Sneaky.  [The SMWS site](https://smwsjapan.com/whisky/44-110) offers a couple more details, namely that "After thirteen years in an ex-bourbon hogshead we transferred this whisky into a New Oak Hogshead / Heavy char #4+".  

* **Color:** chesnut (1.25)
* **Nose:** [muted] vanilla extract, pear, fried chicken; a bit of toluene and pineapple
* **Taste:** wild berry cobbler, ice cream, honey-glazed baked apples; oily jam and barbeque, thyme
* **Finish:** long and rich, not overly sweet; some oak and butter

This is really lovely, super fruity, and can take a solid amount of water without breaking down.  I'd recommend you drink it neat, however, for maximum flavour.

**Rating: 91/100**
