**Aberfeldy 12 / 40%**

*Tasted neat*

[This is batch 2095 of Aberfeldy 12 year](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/76497/aberfeldy-12-year-old), a "limited batch" of 40% ABV, surely chill-filtered, coloured, and not-cask-strength.  The upside is it's fairly cheap, so you can try this Dewar's staple by itself for less than 40 GBP or so.

* **Color:** N/A (1.0)
* **Nose:** ripe apple, banana, whipped cream, and cooked rice
* **Taste:** malty, with salt peanuts, a hint of sherry, and buttered toast  
* **Finish:** unexceptional, dry, hints of jerky

This is quite decent but uninspiring, considering how it's been diluted and coloured for mass market.  Still worth a try if you've never had it before!

**Rating: 78/100**
