**Ben Nevis 1999 Raw Cask 20 Yr / 56.2% / $140**

*Tasted with a bit of mineral water*

[This Ben Nevis](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/150653/ben-nevis-1999-ba) was distilled 13th May 1999 and bottled in May 2019 by Blackadder, bottle number 14 of 112 from an ex-bourbon cask.  The "Raw Cask" series is not only natural colour, cask strength, and non-chill-filtered, it's not filtered at all and contains cask sediments!

* **Color:** chestnut (1.20)
* **Nose:** ethanol, banana cream pudding, swimming pool chlorine, applesauce 
* **Taste:** spearmint, pistachios, baked beans, red vines, rotting forest leaves, vanilla   
* **Finish:** very long, cloves, honey

The best part about this is the weird part about this, which is there are little bits of cask floating around here!  I would buy this again, it's interesting, but it's a departure from the usual Ben Nevis profile.

**Rating: 83/100**
