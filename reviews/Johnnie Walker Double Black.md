**Johnnie Walker Double Black / 40% ABV**

*Tasted neat*

Just returned from a 2 week vacation in Japan (Osaka, Kyoto, Kobe) and Shanghai, my lungs filled with cigarette smoke and smog, so it's time to review this gift from a close friend, which I've never had the chance to try before!  Check out [r/WorldWhisky](http://reddit.com/r/worldwhisky) for a couple more reviews from me.

*Music: TI - What you know (about dat!?)*

* **Color:** the bottle is smoke-grey, the scotch oily amber.  Caramel colouring surely at work here, but it's nice looking.
* **Nose:** plastic, cinnamon, burning bacon, cream
* **Taste:** grass, burnt bark, butter and caramel; smoke
* **Finish:** warming, medium-length, a bit of leather, sweet

I've got to say, for the price, this is pretty decent.  It's surely no Green, but it's tasy and has a lil' bit o' smoke.  It's a perfect "I've had enough but I want one more" dram.

**Rating: 70/100**
