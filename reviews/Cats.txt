**r/scotch Cats / 0% ABV / NCF**

*tasted against my will*

Since it's [become](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/10p10e/johnnie_walker_green_label_a_review/) [increasingly](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/10o70j/my_5th_review_the_macallan_cs/) [popular](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/10mnf5/ardbeg_gallileo_1999_review/) to post [cats](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/10n2vm/sold_a_couple_textbooks_its_gonna_be_a_good_one/) instead of scotch, I thought I'd try my hand at a quick review.

* **Color:** various, mottled white-black/brown, ebony, and tiger
* **Nose:** two of five expose nose
* **Taste:** cats did not taste the scotch
* **Finish:** one looks traumatized, two seem satisfied, and the other two are wary

So guy I'm wonder whats up with all the cats?  Did r/catswap and r/scotchswap have a baby?
