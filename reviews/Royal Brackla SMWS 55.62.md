**Royal Brackla SMWS 55.62 / 56.9%**

*Tasted neat, with a splash of water*

[This 13 year old Royal Brackla](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/161037/royal-brackla-smws-5562) was fancied up in a re-charred hogshead, giving 257 bottles of "Oddfellows in the wardrobe."  This distillery isn't seen often, as it ends up in Dewar's, but it was the first in Scotland to receive a Royal Warrant in 1835.

* **Color:** burnished (1.1)
* **Nose:** honeysuckle, vanilla, coffee cake; with water, musty dunnage, treacle
* **Taste:** tropical fruits, guava, oak, sand; oily graham crackers and strawberry
* **Finish:** quick and clean; pastry sugar

This is a nice fruity dram, but also a bit cardboardy.  It's got a nice chewiness to it though!

**Rating: 82/100**
