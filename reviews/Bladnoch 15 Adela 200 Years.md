**Bladnoch 15 "200 Years" Adela Edition / 48.7% ABV / ~$120**

*Tasted neat*

Another "200 years" release, [this Bladnoch](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/99676/bladnoch-adela) spent 15 years in Oloroso Sherry casks.  Par for the course, it comes in an obnoxiously heavy decanter with a thick glass bottom, of which I am honestly getting a bit tired as it feels like a waste of resources. 

* **Color:** russet (1.3)
* **Nose:** candied berries, sandalwood, burnt sugar, and a hint of plastic
* **Taste:** maple syrup, raspberries, and soft sherry
* **Finish:** medium, some vanilla and cloves

The best adjective I can use to describe this is "soft"; it's pleasant, but inoffensive.  Much of the lowlands spirit style I liked in the 10 year version gets melted into sherry's loving embrace.  

**Rating: 81/100**
