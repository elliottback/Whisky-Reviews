**Signatory Bunnahabhain 1997 / 13 yr / 46%**

*Tasted neat*

You trippy mane?  This was distilled '97 and bottled in '11, #221 of #398.  Natural color, no chill filtering, and "heavily peated" ;)

* **Color:** Rubia en el sol
* **Nose:** mildewed straw, alkaline stagnant standing still water, sulphur
* **Taste:** inoffensive black licorice, lighter fluid, phenol, tires, prunes
* **Finish:** fades quickly, pistachios

These guys need a more accessible name ^yeah^ho.  That doesn't diminish the quality and purity of this Islay scotch, which is delicious.

**Rating: 89/100**
