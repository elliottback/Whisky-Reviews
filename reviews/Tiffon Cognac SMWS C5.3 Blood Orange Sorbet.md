**Tiffon Cognac SMWS C5.3 "Blood Orange Sorbet" / 42.6%**

*Tasted neat*

[This Tiffon Cognac](https://smws.com/blood-orange-sorbet) is one of 515 bottles from a Cognac barrel in the Grande Champagne region of France; appellation cognac grande champagne controlee.  The label hints that is from 1995 without a bottling date, so it will be anywhere between 21-25 years old.

[Comparables](https://www.cognac-expert.com/vintage-cognac/tiffon-vintage-1995-grande-champagne) would go for around £115 to this one at a pleasant £79.  We also gain the benefit of a single cask, at cask strength, as opposed to the vatted vintage release, which is surely several casks and watered to 40%.

* **Color:** russet (1.3)
* **Nose:** brandy grapiness, burnt sugar, jasmine, and chalk 
* **Taste:** icing sugar, chardonnay, mint, orange, and burdock root
* **Finish:** sweet, medium bodied finish with oak and vanilla

I am not a big cognac drinker, but this is quirky, rich and tasty.  It feels a bit green compared to a malt of the same age, but it's perfectly quaffable and complex.

**Rating: 81/100**
