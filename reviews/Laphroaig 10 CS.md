**Laphroaig 10 Cask Strength / 55.3% ABV / NCF**

*tasted neat, then with filtered water*

This bottle is from batch *003 Jan.11*, and is remarkably pleasant at cask strength without water.  If you've never tried a Laphroaig before, it's the most in-your-face Islay scotch.  Medicinal.  *Chemical*.  Cask-strength brings it harder; 10 years young takes *none* of the edge off!

* **Color:** orange-peel gold
* **Nose:** medicinal iodine, w/water honey-baked bread 
* **Taste:** coal tar, charred rubber bands, phenol, huUuuuUge biting sapling-oak
* **Finish:** warm campfire smoke and briny salt spray

I love the oily mouthfeel, just a notch below CS Springbanks. This 10 yr Laphroaig marries iodine, peat, and phenols in its cask-strength charybdis.  While I don't always have a bottle on hand--my goto Islays being Lagavulin and Ardbeg--it's probably because once I open a bottle of Laphroaig it's gone too quickly!

**Rating: 91/100**
