**Flavour Lab Linkwood 14 Year - *The Salty Breeze* / 57.8% / ~$100**

*Tasted neat*

[島嶼海風 Salty Breeze](https://www.facebook.com/pg/SaltyBreeze.TW/posts/?ref=page_internal) are a Taiwanese IB bottling up a few choices drams through Matisse Spirits Co.  This, their second offering, is a Linkwood distilled in 2005 and bottled in 2019 from a bourbon hogshead, and bottled at cask strength in 500ml size.  One of 321 bottles.

They're onto #4, a Fettercain, and it's nice to see new IBs on the market especially out here in Asia.

* **Color:** light amber
* **Nose:** a big grassy nose, with sweet jasmine, clover honey, and raspberry
* **Taste:** ice cream, salty ocean spray, fresh-picked berries and orchids, long-bladed whistling grass
* **Finish:** a long glazing of syrop

I hate 500ml bottles with a passion, so my friend and I set out to buy 8 of these because we liked them so much.  We only found four, but the shop owners comped us ancient promo brandy glencairns from the 80s that appear to be treated with some kind of hydrophobic coating that makes us scared to use them.  Well, it's Taiwan so it's a lot of fun :)

This is probably one of the best Linkwood's I've had the pleasure of trying.

**Rating: 94/100**
