**Bunnahabhain 2003 Lady of the Glen 14 Year / 56.1% / ~$140**

*Tasted neat and with a little bottled water*

Distilled on 05/19/2003 and bottled on 05/09/2018, [this 14 year old "Secret Islay" (Bunnahabhain)](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/115510/secret-islay-2003-lotg) spent its life in a first-fill Olosoro Sherry Butt #1828.  Mine is bottle #189 of a massive 565 total in this cask-strength release.

* **Color:** brown sherry (1.9)
* **Nose:** cracked leather, sandalwood, dry sherry, iodine, and baked bread
* **Taste:** oak, stewed plums, pistachio gelato; pipe smoke, red grapes
* **Finish:** long, warming, and beefy

This is a monster of a dram, and proof that Islay can do more interesting things than just pure peat.

**Rating: 90/100**
