> The [Master of Malt Whisky Advent Calendar](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/drinks-by-the-dram/the-whisky-advent-calendar/) is a $250 box with 24x30ml samples of whisky, including a 50 year old scotch!  To facilitate tasting these little sample, and avoid oversharing, I'll be compiling mine in blocks of 5 and posting them here in an abbreviated format!  Please check out days [1 through 5](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/14d9m2/whiskymas_reviews_days_1_to_5/) and [6 - 10](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/14nd69/whiskymas_reviews_days_6_10/).

**Day 11: [Brown Drink Batch 3](http://www.masterofmalt.com/brown-drink/master-of-malt/master-of-malts-brown-drink-batch-3/brown-drink/?srh=1)**
*41.89% ABV*

If Master of Malt was an American company, they'd be able to divide 750 ml into 30 ml batches evenly, but since they unfortunately are based out of the UK, they have run into the problem that 7 mod 3 leaves 10 ml over per bottle.  They've *solved* this problem by **dumping the remaining bits** into these "Brown Batch" bottlings.  I'm horrified!

* **Color:** e150 amber, murky, not particularly brown
* **Nose:** orange, nutmeg, and cinnamon
* **Taste:** overly sweet, cloves, oil of orange, actual tingling
* **Finish:** bitter mint

If this was supposed to be good, it's not.  It has no redeeming quality.  It's literally a worse version of their [speyside liqueur](http://www.masterofmalt.com/liqueurs/master-of-malt-10-year-old-speyside-whisky-liqueur/?srh=1)...

**Rating: 0/100** 

**Day 12: [Bain's Cape Mountain Whisky](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/james-sedgewick-distillery/bains-cape-mountain-whisky/?srh=1)**
*43% ABV*

South African single-grain whisky, made with local Cape Mountains water.

* **Color:** caramel colouring
* **Nose:** coconut, floral honey, alcohol
* **Taste:** toffee, syrup, and rounded oak
* **Finish:** coconut, minerality, rich cream

No age statement here, but this is a smooth sipping-on-ice sort of whisky that goes down like a piña colada.  It's inoffensive, and while I'd never buy it, I've had far worse Canadians.

**Rating: 58/100** 

**Day 13: [Isle of Arran 12 / '96 Murray McDavid](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/isle-of-arran-12-year-old-1996-mission-murray-mcdavid-whisky/?srh=1)**
*46% ABV*

Finally a single malt!  This is a special IB Arran finished in Premier Cru Margaux casks, and bottled at Bruichladdich in 2008 for 1,500 bottles.  Yum!

* **Color:** nonchillfiltered rougey amber
* **Nose:** grapefruit, malt, heather
* **Taste:** berries, vanilla, tannins, slight smokiness
* **Finish:** floral oakiness, malty & sweet, short

I've had limited experience with wine-finishes on scotches, but this Arran is well integrated.  Whereas with the Ardbeg Galileo I could taste the "Ardbeg Layer" and the "Wine Layers" as two seperate flavours pulling in different directions, this Arran is cohesive and richer.

**Rating: 78/100** 

**Day 14: [Glenfarclas / Movember 2011](http://www.masterofmalt.com/movember/)**
*53% ABV*

A vatting of two 9 year old Glenfarclas sherry-casks.

* **Color:** tough-mudder brown
* **Nose:** cherries.  ow! alcoholic burn
* **Taste:** firey raisins, sherry candy, brie and apricot
* **Finish:** legs for days, leather and cigar smoke

This is the best sample of this batch, and it's quite excellent.  It's a fiery little beast of a sherry-bomb, and differs from the more mature Glenfarclas 105 Cask-Strength in some interesting ways.  The alcohol is more pronounced, and it's less rich, with a more agressive attack on the palate.  The nose is more subdued.

**Rating: 84/100** 

**Day 15: [Compass Box Spice Tree](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/compass-box-spice-tree-whisky/?srh=1)**
*46% ABV*

> a blended malt made from Highland malt whiskies, aged in specially made casks with new French oak heads

* **Color:** pale gold
* **Nose:** brine-o-dine, white pepper
* **Taste:** nuts, pumpkin spice, aromatic fennel
* **Finish:** brief

~~Not~~ a huge ~~fan~~ hater of Compass Box, I don't see any reason why this should exist.  It's like a ruined Talisker or an oversold thinned out Highland Park adultered with miscellaneous herbs.

**Rating: 62/100**
