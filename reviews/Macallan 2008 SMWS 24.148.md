**Macallan 2008 SMWS 24.148 / 63.4% / Â¥16,800**

*Tasted neat*

[The next Macallan single cask](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/180140/macallan-2008-smws-24148) from a parcel of Oloroso casks aged 10 years and then finished in various hogsheads is 24.148.  It spent its last two years in a first-fill ex-Oloroso hogshead, yielding 335 bottles again.

> Dark, darker - yet unexpectedly approachable.  A single malt from oloroso butts, married in a first fill Spanish oak oloroso hogshead since 2018.

* **Color:** old oak (1.8)
* **Nose:** wood shavings, blueberries, malt, rose tea; chocolate fudge
* **Taste:** oily and sweet, foamed milk, strawberry jam; some acidity, pine, and cut grass
* **Finish:** long: butyric acid, nuttiness, and more milk

This sister cask to the PX finished 24.150 lack a lot of the complexity and richness, and also includes some off-putting milky/vomit notes.  It's not for me, but good try!

**Rating: 4/10**
