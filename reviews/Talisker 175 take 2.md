**Talisker 175^th Anniversary / 45.8% / $50**

*Tasted neat*

This is a special vatting of NAS Talisker which promises some "very old" casks, bottled in 2005 for their 175th anniversary.

* **Color:** a bit e150a?
* **Nose:** your gran-gran's flat, plum, anise, honey granola, with a bit of petrichor
* **Taste:** spice, caramel, toffee, salt spray, lemons, and malty smoke
* **Finish:** crusty leather, warm, and reassuring oak

A very drinkable, *smooth* production from Talisker, rich and restrained compared to their fiery 10 year old.  Pleasant, sipping dram, with some nuance, and flavour--true to their marketing, you do feel a bit of age in this one!  I think it may be better than the 18 year old, but I don't have a sample around to check--if anything, it's probably close to equal.  One great thing about this vatting is that there is no seperation of layers, it's fully integrated.

**Rating: 87/100**
