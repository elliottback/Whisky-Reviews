> The [Master of Malt Whisky Advent Calendar](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/drinks-by-the-dram/the-whisky-advent-calendar/) is a $250 box with 24x30ml samples of whisky, including a 50 year old scotch!  To facilitate tasting these little sample, and avoid oversharing, I'll be compiling mine in blocks of 5 and posting them here in an abbreviated format!  Please check out days [1 through 5](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/14d9m2/whiskymas_reviews_days_1_to_5/) and [6 - 10](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/14nd69/whiskymas_reviews_days_6_10/).

**Day 13: [Isle of Arran 12 / '96 Murray McDavid](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/isle-of-arran-12-year-old-1996-mission-murray-mcdavid-whisky/?srh=1)**
*46% ABV*

Finally a single malt!  This is a special IB Arran finished in Premier Cru Margaux casks, and bottled at Bruichladdich in 2008 for 1,500 bottles.  Yum!

* **Color:** nonchillfiltered rougey amber
* **Nose:** grapefruit, malt, heather
* **Taste:** berries, vanilla, tannins, slight smokiness
* **Finish:** floral oakiness, malty & sweet, short

I've had limited experience with wine-finishes on scotches, but this Arran is well integrated.  Whereas with the Ardbeg Galileo I could taste the "Ardbeg Layer" and the "Wine Layers" as two seperate flavours pulling in different directions, this Arran is cohesive and richer.

**Rating: 78/100**
