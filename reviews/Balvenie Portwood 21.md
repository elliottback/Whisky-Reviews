**Balvenie Portwood 21 Yr / 43% / Sample**

*Tasted neat*

Thank you dear /r/ScotchSwap (RIP) member who send me this, at least 7 years ago.  I'm just now getting around to reviewing it, and it has a couple things I like -- Balvenie, a solid distiller, and owned by Family company William Grant & Sons, and a **port** pipe finish. 

* **Color:** tawney (1.4)
* **Nose:** marmalade, orange and lemon zest, damp earth, a little alcohol
* **Taste:** oily and light, cake, cream, elderberry, and dry port 
* **Finish:** long, peychaud's aromatic bitters and lime

This is tasty but one-dimensional, with no layering of flavours, or new notes really hiding from smell to taste to finish.  I've heard there's a higher-proof 47% version out there, but I don't know if it would make much of a difference.

If I were to purchase this in my local, it would cost me about $210; I don't think I'd be a buyer at that price.

**Rating: 81/100**
