**Ballantine's Blended Scotch Whisky Tribute Release 17 Year Old / 48%**

*Tasted neat*

This 17 year-old Blended Scotch Whisky is [Ballantine's Tribute release](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/145904/ballantines-17-year-old) to its original 1937 formulation for its blended malt and grain whisky.  Released as a limited edition for the Japan market.  

Clocking in at a punchier +8% ABV to its entry-level cousin above, this  has a nice age statement, *and* is non-chill filtered.  

I was able to snag this for Â¥6,500 (~$50 USD, depending on exchange rates) on the secondary market, a *significant* ~25% discount to MSRP.  The manufacturing code is LKMA M2963, 2018/07/18 16:46.

* **Color:** tawny (1.4) -- again, *probably* artificially coloured and dialed up a bit to look *older* compared to Ballantine's Finest, but also at 17 years old, if it were a single malt, it could absolutely be this colour in an ex-bourbon cask.  The casks involved here are probably quite the mix of refills.
* **Nose:** acetone, lemon-vanilla tart, beach campfire, baked apple cobbler; a little muted milk chocolate
* **Taste:** fruity green apple, lemon peel, silky sherry undertones, graham cracker, and some grapiness
* **Finish:** medium; icing sugar, cream, honeysuckle and oak

Finally, a mass-market blend that tastes like a proper blend should: ~~smooth~~ rich and complex.  The 17 Tribute  trends towards sweet and balanced, but with some depth and decent integration of the flavours. The concessions to the connoisseur market (punchier ABV, NCF, age statement) are fantastic.

Could we please get more mass-market blended whisky like this? ðŸ¥º
