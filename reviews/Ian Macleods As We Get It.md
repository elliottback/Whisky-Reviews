    STRAIGHT FROM THE CASK

    'AS WE GET IT' is bottled directly from its original casks at cask strength under the sole responsibility of Ian Macleod & Co. Ltd.  Only the very best casks of this smooth bodied Islay Single Malt, which have been matured for many years, are selected for 'AS WE GET IT'.

This has a lot code of 16/03/15.  So what is it?

* **Color:** chestnut
* **Nose:** burning tires, peat smoke, iodine, oak planks, hot liquor
* **Taste:** super tarry, oily mouthfeel; fresh strawberries, flaming kelp, sea urchin
* **Finish:** long and bright

*This one* is Laphroaig.  Who knows what other batches / releases could be.  This is actually quite remarkable, it's like a punchier cask-strength Laphroaig quarter cask!

**Rating: 92/100**
