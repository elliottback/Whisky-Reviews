**Caol Ila Cask Strength / 61.1% / $90**

*Tasted neat*

From Port Askaig, this is a NAS Caol Ila at an incredible 61%.  It's light, peaty, and Caol Ila to the core.

* **Color:** sun-bleached blonde
* **Nose:** peat and cream, carbolic acid, salt
* **Taste:** mouthcoating oiliness, farmland manure, smoke, vanilla, clover
* **Finish:** tangy explosion that sugar coats your mouth, ice cream

This tastes a lot like a rounded out Bunnahabhain, but with less sharpness, and more creamy vanillins.  If you like Caol Ila it's a must try, but it's surely much much younger than OB 12 year, I'd guess around 6-7 years old.

**Rating: 83/100**
