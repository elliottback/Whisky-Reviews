**Chivas Regal 18 Year Gold Signature / 40%**

*Tasted neat*

The [Chivas Regal 18 Year Old Gold Signature](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/66347/chivas-regal-18-year-old)  labels tells us nothing at all about this whisky.  The rumourmill is the malt component has a strong custom Strathisla weighting, but with over 20 distilleries featured in the blend, it's impossible without Chivas disclosure to say anything more. 

* **Color:** chestnut (1.2) -- inevitably caramel coloured
* **Nose:** floral, lots of tropical fruits, hermes d'jardin parfume, unripe apple, pineapple
* **Taste:** prickly pear, sherry, guava, caramel and chocolate
* **Finish:** some cardboard, vanilla, short; a little oak

Inoffensively bland, but recognizably still whisky, you won't be angry drinking this, but I don't think you'll be coming back for more.  Despite the age statement and premium pricing, this doesn't offer good value for the money.

**Rating: 3/10**
