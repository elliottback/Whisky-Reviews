**Talisker 25 / 57.2% ABV / $99**

*Tasted neat, with bottled water*

This is one of the last cask-strength Talisker 25 bottlings, bottled in 2005 (no 14,422/15,600) at natural strength, NCF, from refill oak casks.  This particular bottle was procured from Warehouse Wine & Spirits after Hurrican Sandy, and so is featured sans-box and with water-damaged label as their warehouse was partially flooded. WW&S is notorious for having bought nearly all available Talisker in the North American market.

The mood is a quiet, warm-for-NYC sunday afternoon listening to *Stadium Arcadium*.

* **Color:** golden lion-mane
* **Nose:** slowly opens up to camphor, thistle, crï¿½me and iodine, peat smoke
* **Taste:** full bodied sweetness, vanilla ice cream, subdued white pepper, a hint of oak 
* **Finish:** phenominal; full-grain leather, peat smoke, grapes

I highly recommend a dash of water in this--it really opens it up to deliciousness. Sadly, you will not be able to find this locally for anything better than 46% ABV at $250, which is a shame for Talisker lovers who want to try the entire range.

The first time I really liked whisky, I was trying a Talisker 10 because that's James Bond's favourite dram.  And I loved the fiery iodine, peat, and most of all pepper.  To this day, I recommend without reservation Talisker 10, 18 and my new affordable favourite, the Distiller's Edition aged in a bit of sherry.  The latter is affordable and fantastic.

**Rating: 89/100**
