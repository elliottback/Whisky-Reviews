**Sovereign Ardbeg 21 / 49.6% ABV / $350**

*Tasted with a drop of water*

A single-cask offering [from KLwines](http://www.klwines.com/detail.asp?sku=1155025&cid=TPV-Winesearcher), this was distilled in 1992 and bottled 2013 from a single cask.  The label doesn't indicate natural colour or cask strength but I believe it's both.  Older Ardbeg is impossible to get, and IBs are even rarer, so I was very excited to see it come into stock at KL.

* **Color:** straw and sunbeams
* **Nose:** peat fields, salt spray, burnt earth, rotting kelp
* **Taste:** leather jerky, oily creme, vanilla, iodine, astringent oak
* **Finish:** charred meat, campfire smoke, long

This is a fantastic Ardbeg, the first single cask/IB I've had which may be skewing my review to older/more experienced scotchittors, but absolutely amazing.  If a $400 bottle doesn't break your budget, and you love Islays, you are in for a treat.

**Rating: 96/100**
