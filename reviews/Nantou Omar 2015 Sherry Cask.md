[Nantou Omar's Sherry Cask Cask Strength](http://www.omarwhisky.com.tw/en/product_info.aspx?id=41) ([arch](https://web.archive.org/web/2020*/http://www.omarwhisky.com.tw/en/product_info.aspx?id=41)) editions are full ex-Sherry single casks.  This one today is cask #23150035, bottle #206 of 599, distilled on 01, 2015 and bottled 09, 2020.

* **Color:** brown sherry (1.9)
* **Nose:** PX sherry, brown sugar, cigar smoke, some hot liquor; toasted oak
* **Taste:** spicy wood, leather, some vanilla, oak, and crème brûlée; black licorice and rum
* **Finish:** quite long, sweet, and big on vanilla

This is very typical of hot-climate sherry casks, it's quite nice but also a little hot.  I really wish the climate allowed some extra time on the books.

**Rating: 5/10**
