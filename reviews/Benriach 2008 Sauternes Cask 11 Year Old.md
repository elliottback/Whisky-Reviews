**Benriach 2008 Sauternes Cask 11 Year Old / 61.3% ABV**

*Tasted neat*

[This Benriach](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/169381/benriach-2008) is a Japan special release for Yamaya (Liquor Mountain), distilled on 10/01/2008 and bottled in 2020 from Sauternes Hogshead 5814, after aging for 11 years.  This is bottle 77 of just 295; the liner notes read:

    Nose - Dark chocolate, manuka honey and baked lemons with golden syrup and toasted oak.
    Colour - dark orange sunset
    Taste - buttered brioche with sultana and lingering lemon rind marmalade.

* **Color:** mahogany (1.6)
* **Nose:** burnt chocolate, marmalade, freshly baked bread, and lime zest
* **Taste:** cigar-smoke leather, vanilla ice cream, orange sorbet, black pepper, and shikuwasa citrus
* **Finish:** medium length; icing sugar, toffee, and brownies

What a massive difference from the 16-year-old with a Sauternes finish!  This has spent a full eleven years in the cask, and it's a beautiful, desserty dream.  It's younger, but punchier, and beautifully complex; would buy again!

**Rating: 6/10**
