**Glenburgie 1995 Signatory Vintage  23Yr / 57.5% / $170**

*Tasted neat, then a splash of filtered water*

272 bottles of [this 23 year old Glenburgie](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/134166/glenburgie-1995-sv) were turned out for The Whiskey Exchange's 20th anniversary.  It was distilled 15.06.1995 and bottled on 28.03.2019 from an ex-Bourbon Hogshead at cask strength.  It has a resplendent maroon label.

* **Color:** old gold
* **Nose:** tropical fruits--papaya and pineapple, malt, and vanilla
* **Taste:** creamy and fruity, lots of grape, some tannins, parched leather
* **Finish:** medium, with cream and dry oak

The Glenburgie ends up mostly in Ballantines, and I get the connection now.  This is a little bit hot even with water, and a bit cardboard-y, but still plenty fruity and a good light dram for warm weather.

**Rating: 85/100**
