> The [Master of Malt Whisky Advent Calendar](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/drinks-by-the-dram/the-whisky-advent-calendar/) is a $250 box with 24x30ml samples of whisky, including a 50 year old scotch!  To facilitate tasting these little sample, and avoid oversharing, I'll be compiling mine in blocks of 5 and posting them here in an abbreviated format!  Please check out days [1 - 5](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/14d9m2/whiskymas_reviews_days_1_to_5/), [6 - 10](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/14nd69/whiskymas_reviews_days_6_10/), and [11 - 15](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/159lph/whiskymas_reviews_days_1115/).

**Day 16: [Oban 1995 Montilla Fino Finish Distiller's Edition](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/oban-1995-montilla-fino-sherry-finish-distillers-edition-whisky/?srh=1)**

*43% ABV*

A 14 year old bourbon-cask Oban finished in fresh-fill Montilla sherry casks.

* **Color:** suppressed gold
* **Nose:** vanilla toffee, salt, almonds
* **Taste:** dry sherry, some floral honey
* **Finish:** quick oakiness

The sherry is subdued, it's just a hint of flavour, but well integrated.  It's weaker than the regular Oban 14 year old, and too clean.

**Rating: 73/100** 

**Day 17: [MoM "Island Single Malt"](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/master-of-malt/master-of-malt-island-single-malt-whisky/?srh=1)**

*40% ABV*

Distillery: unknown.  Age: unknown.  ABV: too low!

* **Color:** deep yellow
* **Nose:** phenolic smoke, rubber, burnt tires, bananas
* **Taste:** smoke, very oily vanilla, toasted/spiced seaweed snacks
* **Finish:** heathery peat

I'm guessing this is a Jura, and despite the low ABV it's solid.  This is probably older than twelve year, and aged in refill casks as it lacks the richness of a first-fill 18 year old cask.

**Rating: 79/100** 

**Day 18: [Macallan / Batch 1 / That Boutique-y Whisky Company](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/macallan/macallan-that-boutiquey-whisky-company-batch-1-whisky/?srh=1)**

*40.9% ABV *

A nice dram from well-reviewed and sold out first batch from new IB *That Boutique-y Whisky Company*.

* **Color:** deep golden-brown
* **Nose:** candied fruitcake, sherry, nailpolish
* **Taste:** broken sherry and woody, acidic apples, smoke
* **Finish:** malingering, astringent stringiness

I was expecting more raisins, chocolate, typical big-sherry Macallan flavours, but this drinks more like 12 year.  I think the only issue here is the low ABV...

**Rating: 83/100** 

**Day 19: [Linkwood 12 Year Old - Flora and Fauna](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/linkwood-12-year-old-whisky/?srh=1)**

*43% ABV*

I've never had a linkwood before!  This should be fun.

* **Color:** very pale, diluted mountain dew
* **Nose:** unripe apple, roasted shishito pepper
* **Taste:** subtle, aloe vera and coconut, a touch of pineapple
* **Finish:** long, thick, and sweet, limed malt

This is the perfect blenders malt, it adds all kinds of lovely fruity/floral flavours, has a very light touch, and a nice robust texture.  Love it!

**Rating: 86/100**

**Day 20: [Cutty Sark](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/cutty-sark-blended-scotch-whisky/?srh=1)**

*40% ABV*

Yarrr!  There be a tea clipper here!

* **Color:** very pale
* **Nose:** phenolic pineapple
* **Taste:** tobacco, malt, and tropical fruit
* **Finish:** oily rubber gives way to peroxide

Can't recommend, but it also sells for $25 a bottle.  It is drinkable, but Dewar's White is better.

**Rating: 35/100** 

**Day 21: [Caol Ila 17 Year Old 1990 Sherrywood - Mackillops](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/caol-ila-1990-mackillops-single-malt-whisky/?srh=1)**

*56.3% ABV*

Non-chill filtered, and cask strength.

* **Color:** resume paper
* **Nose:** pepper, huge cloves and pine sap, massive alcohol, spice
* **Taste:** brine, peat smoke, a bit of christmas sherry
* **Finish:** long citrus fading into freshly burnt asphalt

Bit of an odd Caol Ila, a lot like KLwines exclusive Ardbeg single cask they released on the hush.

**Rating: 82/100** 

**Day 22: [Old Fettercairn 10 Year Old ](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/old-fettercairn-10-year-old-whisky/?srh=1)**

*40% ABV*

An interesting Whyte & Mackay former distillery, I've never tried this before.  From East Highlands.

* **Color:** caramel colour? 
* **Nose:** cream, vanilla, malt
* **Taste:** sweet and sticky summer flowers, some smoke
* **Finish:** long, very malty

A hidden gem, which has been since diluted by United Spirits' takeover, lowering of ABV, removal of age statement, and the dropping of the "Old" from the brand...

**Rating: 87/100** 

**Day 23: [Aberlour 17 Year Old / MoM](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/aberlour-17-year-old-single-cask-master-of-malt-whisky/?srh=1)**

*56% ABV*

A Master of Malt single cask, 265 bottles, bourbon cask.  Suspicions arise...

* **Color:** stately, pale, yellow
* **Nose:** baked apples, clover
* **Taste:** lemon cakes, salt-orange-jerky
* **Finish:** oak fades to malty caramel

Quite a unique dram--I haven't had too many bourbon-cask Aberlours, and this one is no slouch.  17 years have not done it any harm!

**Rating: 91/100** 

**Day 24: [Master of Malt 50 Year Old Speyside (3rd Edition) ](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/master-of-malt-50-year-old-speyside-whisky/?srh=1)**

*43% ABV*

Finally, the big deal of the bunch, a whisky nearly twice my age, from a well-known Speyside distillery.  It could really be [nearly anything](http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/jhb/whisky/spey.html)!

* **Color:** pond scum, that yellow-green tinge of frogs
* **Nose:** indelibly fruity, astringent, and zesty
* **Taste:** spiced sangria, lemons and grapefruit
* **Finish:** long oak fades into tannins, sherry, chocolate, and then earl grey tea

Very nice and the finish is to kill for.  It's not a speysider I'm familiar with, but it's definitely also not a heavily sherried (if at all) vatting, so Aberlour is perhaps back in.  Would I buy it for $400 a bottle?  Definitely not, but it's fun to try an ancient scotch.  Grandpa holds up remarkably well!

**Rating: 88/100**
