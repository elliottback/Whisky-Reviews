**Alberta Premium Dark Horse / 45% ABV / $28**

*Tasted neat*

I was in Vancouver for a wedding in Kelowna, British Columbia with my father, and while chain smoking late into the night and listening to stories, we polished off a bottle of the not-bad-at-all Alberta Premium regular whisky (we had other help).  So I endeavored to buy a bottle to bring back and review, and settled on this one!  Alas, much of it spilled out in transit--the screw caps come loose very easily--but I've got about 2oz left.  My luggage was very fragrant...

Dark Horse is a 12yr/6yr small-pot blended rye that differs from the regular version in that it's 5% higher ABV and aged in overcharred barrels.  It also gets an "added touch" of 8% corn whisky and .5% sherried whisky.

* **Color:** flushed sherry, caramel, other artificial coloring
* **Nose:** fruitcake, young oak, candied hawthorn, alcohol
* **Taste:** rich texture, big hits of rye, vanilla and tobacco
* **Finish:** delicious sweetness and hits of spice

I have to say that this quite an excellent rye that drinks more like a Speysider!  If you're ever in Canada, you won't be disappointed.  I review without regard to price, so this may have the best quality / price ratio of anything I've ever had!

**Rating: 86/100**
