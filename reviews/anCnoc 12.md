**anCnoc 12 / 43% ABV / $32**

*Tasted with a drop of water*

This is my first dram from The Knockdhu distillery at black Knock hill in Banffshire.  This distillery is owned by Thai Beverages, producers of Chang beer.  I got it from Liquorama thanks to a groupon deal super-cheap.

* **Color:** caramel colour, a bit lighter than others
* **Nose:** cream, fresh-baked bread, light chablis, honeysuckle
* **Taste:** thick, oily texture; tingly green apple, lavender, thin-bodied lemon-tart
* **Finish:** long, oaky, and honied

This is a surprise to me, as it normally runs around $40-50 in NYC, a cheaper election, but it's a very light, lovely dram with great floral aspects.  I'll definitely be trying other Knockdhu expressions in the future!

**Rating: 87/100**
