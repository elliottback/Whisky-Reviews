**Willett Family Estate Rye 4 Year Old / 56.4% / $65 USD**

*Tasted neat*

[This Willett Family Estate Bottled Small Batch Rye](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/162584/willett-04-year-old) was aged for four years in White Oak barrels and hand bottled at cask strength.  The mashbill is a blend of Willett's high rye mashbill (74% rye, 11% corn, 15% malted barley) and low rye mashbill (51% rye, 34% corn, 15% malted barley).

Unlike some of their older whisky, which is sourced, or partially sourced, this is entirely distilled by Willett themselves.

* **Color:** russet (1.3)
* **Nose:** ethanol, spices, toluene, lemongrass, apple, and corn
* **Taste:** really sweet, milk chocolate, fresh-sawn pine boards, butyric acid, lemon 
* **Finish:** short; grainy

Too hot, and too *strange* for me.  I quite like rye as a category, but this new entrant, priced to parity with much-longer established brands and distilleries, doesn't offer me a superior experience.

**Rating: 3/10**
