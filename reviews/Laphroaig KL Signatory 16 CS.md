**[1997 Laphroaig 16 Year Old K&L Exclusive Signatory Single Barrel Cask Strength](https://www.klwines.com/detail.asp?sku=1142679) / 55.2% ABV / $116**

*Tasted neat, w/bottled water*

This is bottle 250 or 283, a small release from K&L via Signatory, Laphroaig cask 3365, distilled 4/28/1997 and bottled 9/7/2013 matured in an ex-bourbon hogshead.  Natural Colour.  K&L describes this as ambrosia:

> Now we have another cask of Laphroaig and it's difficult not to oversell it. If we're always so effusive about every whisky we taste, people start to question our judgment. So, I'm just going to say that this is top-tier Laphroaig. It's in that prime moment between the intensity of a young Laphroaig and that depth of the older offerings from this legendary distillery. 

You'll note that the cork is starting to turn to powder, which is unfortunate...

* **Color:** deep amber, pudding, spoiled by slight inclusions of powdered cork
* **Nose:** a first wave of creamy clover, butter, and hardwood smoke; the second wave is fiery peat, iodine, phenolics
* **Taste:** sharp, grassy with peat, a bit oaky around the edges, fantastic oily texture
* **Finish:** long, floral, and thick

This is not my favourite Laphroaig, but it's a very interesting one.  Aside from the issue with the lifespan of this cork, it's fantastic, and poised interestingly between the young fiery stuff and the different wooded expressions.  There's more gravitas and intensity present.  As usual, Signatory Cask Strength maintains its reputation for excellence.

**Rating: 90/100**
