* **Color:** mahogany (1.6)
* **Nose:** black pepper, cherry soda, pine sap, two-part epoxy, and white peach 
* **Taste:** roast ham, butter, lots of pine, ripe plum, and sherry
* **Finish:** long, sweet; liquorice and jerky

This is fantastic stuff; not a whiff of rubbery or sulphur, just a heavy-hitting rich sherry monster, extremely fruity.

**Rating: 92/100**
