**Review: Springbank 12 Cask Strength / 54.6% ABV**

*tasted neat, then with a bit of filtered water*

* Color: sunshine and gold hide burnt umber in accumulation
* Nose: toffee, cocoa, citrus
* Taste: salted figs toasted with honey, a bit of pepper and oily peat
* Finish: raisins to start, fading to sweet grapes, a veritable marathon in length.  dirt.

As I'm *very near* =[ to the very end of this bottle, I thought scotchit would appreciate a review of the last dram.  And, it's a *delicious* one!

The Springbank 12/CS is matured in sherry casks for that smooth, sweet balance; its thick, oily texture pulls your tastebuds in, and the ageless finish lolls in your throat like corks bobbing on the sea.  Everything you're looking for in a good scotch is here--complexity in flavour, interesting texture, a great nose, no E150/chill filtering, cask strength, and will cost you around $60 or so.

This bottle is a dram I'll **definitely pick up again** whenever I see it.

**Rating: 93/100**
