**Glenrothes 1996 Kingsbury 20 Year Old / 51.9%**

*Tasted neat*

[This Glenrothes](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/137332/glenrothes-1996-kb) is a rare ex-bourbon hogshead treat, cask #51 giving us just 214 bottles produced.  It was distilled in 1996 and bottled presumably in 2016/.  The tasting notes promise "golden, spicy, luscious, toffee, brioche, impressive, magnificent."

I can't quite get over how silly the Kingsbury tasting notes are!

* **Color:** amontillado sherry (0.9)
* **Nose:** dunnage warehouse, tropical fruits, lemon zest, and creamed corn
* **Taste:** lemonade, vanilla, peanut brittle, and orchids
* **Finish:** oaky rich smoked ice cream

This is really lovely stuff; big, but delicate, floral and something I never thought I would say about Glenrothes.  

**Rating: 90/100**
