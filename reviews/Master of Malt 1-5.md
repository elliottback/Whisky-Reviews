> The [Master of Malt Whisky Advent Calendar](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/drinks-by-the-dram/the-whisky-advent-calendar/) is a $250 box with 24x30ml samples of whisky, including a 50 year old scotch!  To facilitate tasting these little sample, and avoid oversharing, I'll be compiling mine in blocks of 5 and posting them here in an abbreviated format!

**Day 1: [Aberlour a'Bunadh Batch 42](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/aberlour/aberlour-abunadh-batch-42-whisky/?srh=1)**
*60.3% ABV & NCF*

I've had earlier batches (most recently before, but this one is paler and more alcoholic.

* **Color:** gold
* **Nose:** alcohol, sherry, raisins, oak, sour grapes
* **Taste:** tobacco, candied fruit, leather and wood, more sherry
* **Finish:** honey sweetness, long but not quite as long as I remember

This is quite good but the alcohol is more overpowering than older batches, and the sherry is less integrated.  Too many refils?  Still a great dram, but now you need a drop or two of water.

**Rating: 89/100** 

**Day 2: [The Irishman Single Malt](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/the-irishman-single-malt-whiskey/?srh=1)**
*40% ABV*

Matured in bourbon/sherry casks.  It's Irish, don't kill me, it's a single malt ...

* **Color:** schoolbus yellow
* **Nose:** turpentine, orange peel
* **Taste:** headachy lemon, bit of malt, too-young oak
* **Finish:** vanilla, short

Not a huge fan, it's almost exactly like you mixed Jameson and Dalmore 12 50:50, which no sane person would ever do.  So getting a little sample of this witches brew is ... interesting!

**Rating: 67/100**

**Day 3: [Ardbeg 18 Single Cask](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/ardbeg/ardbeg-18-year-old-single-cask-master-of-malt-whisky/?srh=1)**
*56.3% ABV / NCF*

This one is a Master of Malt special Indie Bottling from a refill ex-sherry cask.  This could be good...

* **Color:** sunbleached blonde hair flying through a bright summer day (at the beach, naturally)
* **Nose:** phenolic, stirred ash raining from the sky, billowing kelp smoke, pineapple
* **Taste:** hot, sharp, biting peat with ginger, a bit of pepper
* **Finish:** amazingly long, cherry-topped icecream and s'mores

I still prefer the Uigeadail, but this is feels rounder in the mouth.  It's less intense.

**Rating: 85/100**

**Day 4: [15 Yr Speyside Liqueur](http://www.masterofmalt.com/liqueurs/master-of-malt-15-year-old-speyside-whisky-liqueur/?srh=1)**
*42% ABV*

So apparently Master of Malt decided to make their own [Drambuie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drambuie) by adding "Orange Peel, Cloves, and a deliciously spicy hint of Cardamom" to a heavily sherried Speyside.  Hey, isn't this what Compass Box does!?

* **Color:** Brown
* **Nose:** [someone not following this guide to make an old fashioned](http://oldfashioned101.com/)
* **Taste:** eggnog with sherry
* **Finish:** orange peel and bourbon

I don't think I could drink this.  I will be looking for something to mix it with ASAP.  Feel bad for the 15yr Spey that died to make this :(

**Rating: 15/100**

**Day 5: [Bowmore 18](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/bowmore-18-year-old-whisky/?srh=1)**
*43% ABV*

I have only tried Bowmore 10 which was extremely inpalatable, and had to be watered down with some nice Aberlour 12 before I could finish it off slowly.  I'm actually looking forward to trying this one!

* **Color:** rich gold
* **Nose:** thick, syrupy peaches and smoke
* **Taste:** floral oak, like chewing on a shipping pallet
* **Finish:** thin sugar, solid smoke, it bites!

Hmm!  I'm OK with this--it's like a beefed up, peatier, smokier version of Oban 14, and has a great finish.  Bowmore, can we be friends now?

**Rating: 84/100**
