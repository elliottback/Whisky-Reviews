**Glenrothes 2007 Carn Mor 13 Year Old / 47.5%**

*Tasted neat*

[This Glenrothes](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/167868/glenrothes-2007-mswd) is a vatting of two sherry butts distilled in 2007 and bottled in 2020 at 13 years old for Morrison Scotch Whisky Distillers (MSWD)'s *Càrn Mòr Strictly Limited* label.  The out-turn is a whopping 1628 bottles!

On the label we get spare tasting notes: "Beautifully rich with sweetness of stewed fruits and spicy undertones," and note that this is non-chill filtered and natural colour, but NOT cask strength.

* **Color:** brown sherry (1.9)
* **Nose:** rhum-like brown sugar, milk chocolate, coconut, rhubarb, and berry compote
* **Taste:** vanilla, PX sherry, butter, milk chocolate again, raisins, and orange zest
* **Finish:** medium; quite gentle sweetness, some spice and beef jerky

This goes into prime sherry-bomb territory, coca-cola syrupy dark spirit, but it's younger *and* tamed down to just shy of 48%.  It's good, but the new 47.5% Carn Mors aren't as good as when they were cask strength.

**Rating: 6/10**
