**Highland Park 12 Year Old / 40%**

*Tasted neat*

This is the flagship [Highland Park 12](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/96755/highland-park-12-year-old) OB release in 350ml size, aged for twelve years and claiming to be "a uniquely smooth, balanced single malt, with a RICH FULL FLAVOUR and a gentle smoky finish."

* **Color:** e150a (burnished/1.1)
* **Nose:** almost nothing, faint hints of whisky, apples, nail polish, and cardboard
* **Taste:** jalape√±o hot sauce, some oak, caramel, bacon candy, and butyric acid 
* **Finish:** short; maple syrup

Having recently tried Watt Whisky's cask-strength highland park, I cannot enjoy this.  Even with ice, it's just not good; I would honestly prefer a decent blend like JWB with more flavour than HP12.

**Rating: 2/10**
