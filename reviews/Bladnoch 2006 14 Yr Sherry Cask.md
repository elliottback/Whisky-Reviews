**Bladnoch 2006 14 Year Sherry Cask / 51.1%**

*Tasted neat*

[This Bladnoch](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/159237/bladnoch-2006) was distilled December 2006 and Bottled in March 2020 from Sherry Butt #420; this is bottle number of 641/661.  It's a single-cask, non-chill-filtered, cask-strength release!

Besides the liquid, it comes in a very thick-glass square decanter with a metal-ringed stopper and an extra inch of glass on the bottom, corners smoothly rounded off.  The bottle is a little bit "extra".

* **Color:** russet (1.3)
* **Nose:** figs, brown sugar, orange marmalade, cigar smoke, and leather 
* **Taste:** dry plums, baked leather, that "new plastic" smell, citrus spritz, and malty sherry  
* **Finish:** medium; lean beef jerky and icing 

A lowland sherry bomb, what a surprise! This is surprisingly good, no off notes or excessive sulphur. The flavours turns surprisingly between flat/baked and rich/marvellous. Excellent texture.

**Rating: 92/100**
