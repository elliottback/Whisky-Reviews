**Springbank 15 / 46% / $110**

*Tasted neat*

This is the classic [Springbank 15](http://springbank.scot/whisky/springbank/15-years/) for the Japan market (dedicated label!), batch code 25.11.19 19/456.  I believe it is a blend of ex-Bourbon/Sherry casks, but few details are on offer...

    Like a storm gathering off the Kintyre coast, our 15-year-old Springbank is dark and ominous, yet delicious. Best enjoyed after dinner or with your favourite cigar, this is a true classic.

* **Color:** tawny (1.55)
* **Nose:** peatier than I remember Springbank to be, butterscotch, nut brittle, winter spiced wine, star anise   
* **Taste:** dirty and muddled peatiness, a little chocolate, pork cracklings, some kind of briney/fishy flavour; bubblegum 
* **Finish:** medium, underwhelming and a hint of butyric acid

This has got quite the funk; I'm not a fan at all.  It's slightly drinkable for me, I would most likely not buy it again.  Is it true that there is often a lot of batch variation in Springbank?  I've included the batch code above just in case.  

**Rating: 61/100**
