**Ben Nevis 20 "Distilleries Collection" / 51.6% ABV / $140**

*Tasted with some filtered tap water*

This appears to be an IB created by Japanese Bottler [Distilleries Collection](https://scotch-malt.co.jp/distilleries-collection)/Scotch Malt Sales Ltd, distilled in 1996 and then aged 20 years in a Sherry cask of some kind.

* **Color:** light brown
* **Nose:** fruity grape juice, yeast, and a bit of rubber and antifreeze
* **Taste:** quite odd!  very thin, sharp profile.  Decaying vegetation, sparkling dry sherry, some oakiness
* **Finish:** nothing to write home about

I am not sure what kind of Sherry cask this sat in, but it's not my cup of tea.  The perils of Single Cask small IB runs...

**Rating: 35/100**
