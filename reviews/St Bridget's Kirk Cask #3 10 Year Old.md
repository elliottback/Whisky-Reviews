**St Bridget's Kirk - Cask #3 - 10 Year Old / 48.5%**

*Tasted neat*

From Hannah Whisky Merchants Ltd, whose primary offerings so far are very lovely IB bottles from their *Lady of the Glen* imprint comes a new series of blended malt whiskies, *St. Bridget's Kirk*), named for a [ruined medieval church](https://www.historicenvironment.scot/visit-a-place/places/st-bridgets-kirk/) in Fife (see also this [lovely interview with Malt-Review](https://malt-review.com/2022/08/19/st-bridgets-kirk-blended-malt/)).

This blend was made from four whiskies from Islay, Highland and Speyside matured in an oloroso butt, and is 10 years old.  It was bottled on 23rd Aug 2022, and this is bottle 636 of 705 total.  There is no artificial colouring or chill-filtration.  The label notes promise:

> Medicinal smokiness with blood orange zest and lime
> 
> Sea salt, candied ginger with honey and vanilla

* **Color:** brown sherry (1.9) with notable unfiltered matter / turbidity
* **Nose:** peat smoke, black liquorice, brown sugar, and toasted oats
* **Taste:** dry sherry, medicinal iodine, sea spray, and spice; toasted vanilla
* **Finish:** long, with honey and the sherry, ending in more peat 

At a pretty affordable price of Â£67, this is a great value blend for the following reasons:

* +8.5% ABV
* NCF/natural colour
* Well-integrated sherry / peat -- almost a less polarizing version of the Elements Sherry & Islay 50%er
* Age statement (10 years is pretty good!)

It's right where I want it, and I would definitely buy this or another batch again.

**Rating: 5/10**
