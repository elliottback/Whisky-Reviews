**Glenfarclas 12 Cask Strength (Batch 4) / 57.6% ABV / ¥11,200 (~$100)**

*Tasted neat / with some bottled mineral water*

This is the [fourth installment of Glenfarclas's Japan Exclusive 12 Year Old Cask Strength](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/223433/glenfarclas-12-year-old) release; this year the packaging has been revamped to include a more glorious blue and gold motif on the label.

All we know is that it's 12 years old, cask strength, and we can guess probably not coloured or chill-filtered.

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** dark rum, turpentine, pine needles, salt caramel, sliced apples, sherry; a little floral notes 
* **Taste:** brown sugar, beef jerky, oloroso sherry, and lemon; minerality, pineapple, green apple
* **Finish:** long, sweetness, a little black pepper, and oak; campfire smoke

While whisky has gotten more expensive, this is still a relatively affordable competitor in the young sherried category (Macallan 12 Sherry Oak is ¥12,950) and I think Glenfarclas has done a good job putting together a cask-strength option at this price point.

There's a lot more complexity than you'll get from most of its competitors, and some lovely fruity/floral notes in this batch.  The downside is that these releases are Japan-exclusive (why?!) and limited, they will and do regularly sell out until the next batch arrives.

If you live in Japan, this is still relatively available to purchase.  Mukawa has [6 bottles](https://mukawa-spirit.com/?pid=171805891) at regular price and [1 bottle](https://mukawa-spirit.com/?pid=171886464) with a defective label 10% off.

**Rating: 6/10**
