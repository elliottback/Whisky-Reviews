**Signatory Cask Strength Clynelish 1995 22 YR / 55.4% ABV/ $150**

*Tasted with a splash of filtered tap water*

This is from Signatory's lovely **Cask Strength** collection which comes in oddly shaped bottles.  This Clynelish was distilled 11/21/1995, left to rest in cask #11230 refill sherry butt, and bottled as #46/601 on 7/20/2018.  It is naturally coloured.

I didn't like the previous bottle of this that I tried, but single-cask stuff can often be polarizingly different.  We'll give it one more try!

* **Color:** light mahogany
* **Nose:** musty sherry, figs, chlorine, a bit of lemon
* **Taste:** rich and syopy, with an odd undertone of acetone, sherry, some citrus and brimstone
* **Finish:** medium, powdered sugar and cake, sulphur

This one's a good bit thicker and better than the previous bottle I tried, but it's not quite my favourite sort of sherry bomb.  It seems to have too many rough edges, and not enough complexity.

**Rating: 68/100**
