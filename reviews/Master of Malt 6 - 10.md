> The [Master of Malt Whisky Advent Calendar](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/drinks-by-the-dram/the-whisky-advent-calendar/) is a $250 box with 24x30ml samples of whisky, including a 50 year old scotch!  To facilitate tasting these little sample, and avoid oversharing, I'll be compiling mine in blocks of 5 and posting them here in an abbreviated format!  Please check out days [1 through 5](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/14d9m2/whiskymas_reviews_days_1_to_5/).

**Day 6: [Tyrconnell 10 Year Old Sherry Cask](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/tyrconnell-10-year-old-sherry-cask-finish-whisky/?srh=1)**
*46% ABV*

An Irish whisky with sherry cask?  Interesting, let's see how it stacks up...

* **Mood:** Gary Clark Jr.
* **Color:** dull gold, the fort knox deal
* **Nose:** sherry, cider, cinnamon
* **Taste:** oranges, toasted oak, salt and honey
* **Finish:** not a lot here; sugar, strawberries

Drinkable, smooth, extremely floral with nice sherry highlights.  Could swear I picked up a bottle of thick Oban.  Nothing stands out, though!

**Rating: 82/100** 

**Day 7: [Benrinnes 14 - MoM Single Cask](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/benrinnes/benrinnes-14-year-old-single-cask-master-of-malt-whisky/?srh=1)**
*57.8% ABV / NCF / Natural Colour*

This Speyside gem is heavily sherried, which means I'll probably have to go order a case of it in a few minutes...

* **Color:** sunset
* **Nose:** sulphur, alcohol, heather & pears, musty smokeroom
* **Taste:** candied starburst, cherries, leather, pie fruit from a can
* **Finish:** long slow warmth, leathery marshmellow and blackberry

Who let the Sherry out?  Who?  Who?  I have to say I love this, Benrinnes is awesome.  I feel like I've unearthed an ancient wonder here.  Compared to the usual sherry bottlings, it has a unique and thoroughly enjoyable character.

**Rating: 93/100** 

**Day 8: [Isle Of Skye 8 yr (Ian Macleod) ](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/isle-of-skye-8-year-old-whisky/?srh=1)**
*40% ABV*

It is described as "an 8 year old blend from Ian Macleod, [...] malt whisky from Speyside and the Islands."  OK, so Talisker and something, and tons of caramel colour.  If I don't get my pepper, I'm going to hate this...

* **Color:** piss
* **Nose:** alcoholic sprites and cream
* **Taste:** tobacco up front, then vanilla, slight oak, some floral notes
* **Finish:** a quick roll in the hay.  Cough-syrup sweet.

I should have been nicer to the Tyrconnell, because this has absolutely no character.  Dewar's White is more interesting.  It doesn't hurt me though.

**Rating: 39/100** 

**Day 9: [Caol Ila 12](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/caol-ila-12-year-old-whisky/?srh=1)**
*43% ABV*

Can I really review this again?  I love Caol Ila--even the regular 12--but it's a *staple*.

* **Mood:** Aggressively listening to [Prodigy](http://www.gorillaconvict.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/PRODIGY1.jpg)
* **Color:** straw
* **Nose:** oooh, those fumes of goddess iodine, peat, burnt rubber, plastic, and umami
* **Taste:** delicious oily texture complements a pure spring water, peat, lemon and leaves flavour
* **Finish:** you're a fire breathing dragon, Jack!

Caol Ila 12 is a great Islay, a dirtier version of Lagavulin 12 that will hit you below the belt and leave you satisfied.  At least until you start wanting cask-Strength Caol Ila...

**Rating: 89/100** 

**Day 10: [Glenfarclas 105](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/glenfarclas-105-whisky/?srh=1)**
*60% ABV*

Ironically I opened a full bottle of this which I brought home 2 weeks ago after a wedding in Phoenix (it was cheap there!) last night.  However, I haven't evaluated it yet:

* **Color:** blood-iron
* **Nose:** sherry, figs, daisies
* **Taste:** a little raisiny, astringent oak, honey bees and summer flowers, chinese preserves
* **Finish:** fire rages up from the sweet finish, tickling your nostrils, retreating to its dragon-lair of sherry, ending in a solitary withered fig

I like it!  It's not as thick as Abunadh, a bit more refined in palate.  The finish is shorter but impressive, and it's a sherry-bomb for sure that earns its place with Aberlours and the Macallan CS.

**Rating: 91/100**
