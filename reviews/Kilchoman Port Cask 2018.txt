**Kilchoman Port Cask 2018 / 50% / $120**

*Tasted neat*

This is the 2018 edition of Kilchoman, matured in Port casks.  One of 10,000, non-chill filtered and natural colour.

I've always liked Islay in Port--how does this stack up?

* **Color:** russet
* **Nose:** stableyards, sweet wine, rotting moss, and alcohol
* **Taste:** rich and sweet, tawny port, blueberry jam and butter
* **Finish:** vanilla, a little oakiness; short

This is quite lovely; the port influence works very well with Kilchoman spirit.  It's a sweet, relaxing dram.  It's downsides are a lack of complexity and a bit of age to round out the rough bits.

**Rating: 82/100**
