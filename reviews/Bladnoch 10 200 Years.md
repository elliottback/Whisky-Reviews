**Bladnoch 10 "200 Years" Edition / 46.7% ABV / $40**

*Tasted neat*

[This Bladnoch](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/113367/bladnoch-10-year-old) is new to me as a distillery, a new 2018 special OB release celebrating their 200th anniversary, and bottled at a decent strength as well!  Non-chill filtered and ex-bourbon barrels.

Lowlands is experiencing a bit of a renaissance of late, so I was quite excited to give this one a try.  One interesting feature is the decanter-style bottle with an extra thick glass base, which feels quite premium.

* **Color:** pale gold (0.35)
* **Nose:** grass, cream, orange popsicle, and salt
* **Taste:** vanilla, bright cut grass, petrichor, green apple, and thyme  
* **Finish:** medium, angel food cake

This is excellent, young and bright, and very tasty.  It reminds me of some young Linkwoods, and the characteristic of the spirit is quite promising.  I look forward to exploring more Bladnoch in the future.

**Rating: 82/100**
