**Wardhead 1997 22 Year / 54.7% ABV / $150?**

*Tasted neat*

So this is the stickied teaspooned Glenfiddich IB for r/scotch from FineDrams, which I am excited to review!  Refill hogshead Cask #40 distilled 20.02.1997 and bottled 07.10.2018.

* **Color:** amber
* **Nose:** barnyard horses and straw, anejo vino, dock ropes
* **Taste:** massive oak that blossems into fruity notes, acerbic dog hair, toluene on the palate; thistle
* **Finish:** sweet, buttery, long -- maybe the best part

This is a rough Glenfiddich; there must be some kind of production pressure to run the tails wide.  Drinking 10ml feels like I am already poisoning my body, somehow.  With their regular releases they can blend away and age away the imperfections.  The general paucity of single cask Glenfiddichs leads me to believe that their process is poor and they are just pumping out as much as they can for their OB blends.

**Rating: 58/100**
