**Jura Signatory 12 / 46% **

*Tasted neat*

This bottle of **Isle of Jura** was distilled in 1997, left for 12 years in refill butts, and bottled in 2010.  This is one of 831, natural colour & NCF.

* **Color:** 白酒; seriously, this is the lighest whisky I've *ever* met
* **Nose:** shellac, sublimating plastic, rotting bananas, fermented soy sauce, and rubbing alcohol
* **Taste:** moldy lemons, smoked rubber, furniture polish
* **Finish:** butyric acid, vinegar

This dram cements my feeling that Jura is piss distilled hooch by some island monk who subsides on a diet of roadkill.

Friends don't let friends drink Jura.

**Rating: 0/100**
