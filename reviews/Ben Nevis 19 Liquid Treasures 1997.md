**Ben Nevis 19 Liquid Treasures 1997 / 51.9% / $200?**

*Tasted neat*

Here we have [a Ben Nevis](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/89418/ben-nevis-1997-lt) (the powerhouse of Japan's blends) distilled in 1997, bottled 2016 from an ex-bourbon hogshead.  This was imported to Japan by Acornsquare; there is no mention of a single cask, cask numbers, or size of the outturn.

* **Color:** blonde
* **Nose:** very nutty, a funky earthy aroma, pecans, vanilla ice cream
* **Taste:** super malty, estery, banana bread, unsalted sunflower seeds
* **Finish:** really long and pleasant, like eating a nutty choco

I can't really describe this Ben Nevis well, but it's complex and tasty; I'd buy it again =]

**Rating: 86/100**
