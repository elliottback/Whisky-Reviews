**Glenrothes Sovereign 8 / 59.4%**

*Tasted neat*

This is a single-cask Glenrothes that was exclusively bottles for KLWines, distilled 2005 and bottled in 2013.

One thing I have to say is (a) the bottles that KL puts for these single casks are gorgeous, and (b) this was cheap, but I don't remember how cheap.  I'm thinking < $50.

* **Color:** ochre
* **Nose:** sour cream, sherry, damp leaves, black tea with burnt sugar
* **Taste:** while no hint of alcohol on the nose, an aggressive bite with a blast of fruity sherry, tobacco smoke, apple-skins, and raisins
* **Finish:** hot sweat, leather, cream

This young firecracker is quite interesting, as I tend to dislike Glenrothes's retail offerings as compared to other Sherry monsters.  Since it's extremely young, probably aged in quite good sherry, and bottled at cask strength, it really gives you a powerful insight into the character of the whisky.  It's not well-rounded like Macallan CS or laid back like Abunadh.  But it's unique and pleasant.

**Rating: 84/100**
