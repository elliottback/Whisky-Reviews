**Daftmill 2009 Summer Batch Release (UK) / 46% ABV / $110**

*Tasted neat*

[This Daftmill](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/175387/daftmill-2009) is a bit of a special one, it's the very first to have had some ex-sherry matured whisky included into the vatting.  At 11 years old, this is a vatting of 4 bourbon barrels and 1 oloroso first-fill sherry butt.  With the barrels sitting at 200 litres, and the sherry butt at 500 litres, this gives us ~38% ex-sherry in the whisky<sup>1</sup>.

*1) these ratios will drift a bit because of the different evaporation characteristics, so call it a generous 1/3*

* **Color:** russet (1.3) 
* **Nose:** dry sherry, chestnuts, ethanol, and ice cream
* **Taste:** slightly oily, banana bread and toffee, butyric acid, mint, and cinnamon
* **Finish:** really nutty long finish, turns to honey

To my vast surprise, I prefer the 100% ex-bourbon vattings I've tried before.  This gains a little maturity, and some mellow sweetness from the sherry treatment, but loses a lot of its character.

**Rating: 85/100**
