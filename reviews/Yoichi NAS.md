**Nikka Whisky "Single Malt " Yoichi / 45% / $40**

This is the latest reworked NAS Yoichi from Nikka as they work on matching immense demand with very little supply.

* **Color:** pale
* **Nose:** green apples, mustiness, honey, cereal grains, some salty smoke and peat
* **Taste:** pears, vanilla ice cream, some grassy notes
* **Finish:** medium, not unpleasant; malingering lemons

I very much miss the days of cheap Yoichi with:

* Age statements
* Cask strength bottles
* "Heavily peated"
* Various cask finishes

The Yoichi Single Malt NAS is a well put-together, but boring, single malt.

**Rating: 75/100**
