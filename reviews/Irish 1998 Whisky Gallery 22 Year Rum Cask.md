**Irish 1998 Whisky Gallery 22 Year Rum Cask / 53.6% / $300**

*Tasted neat*

There are still [three in stock of this 22 year old un-named Irish](https://www.acornsquare.jp/SHOP/WE22025-75.html), which was distilled in 1998 and aged in rum cask #100037 for 22 years.  Not much else known except that it was bottled exclusively for Whisk-E Japan under the Whisky Gallery imprint, and features what I guess to be an 18th century British watercolour landscape.  Acorn says it's Pastoral Landscape by Francois Boucher, but I'm not sure!

* **Color:** chestnut (1.2)
* **Nose:** applesauce, sliced pears, some brown sugar, caramel, and tropical fruit
* **Taste:** very oaky, vanilla, milk chocolate, minerals, pineapple, cantaloupe, and graham crackers
* **Finish:** quite long, sweet, with baked tarte, oak, and cobbler

I have not tried much Irish whisky, let alone single casks, but this is quite a nice suprise.  Just 22 years old, and in an unusual cask, it comes out quite matured, rich and oaky, and very fruity.  It's a win in my book!

I suspect this may be Cooley?

**Rating: 7/10**
