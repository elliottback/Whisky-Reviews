**Msheinberg Mystery Dram / 46% ABV (?)**

*tasted neat, mr. shiny*

I stopped by to say hello and restock on some Lagavulin 12, and msheinberg kindly gave me this sample of an unknown peated scotch.  We'll now subject it to my cigarette-numbed palate, ok?

* **Color:** medium yellow
* **Nose:** vanilla milkshake, jelly beans
* **Taste:** Creme fraiche, blackberry tannins, heather
* **Finish:** smoke, oak, and honey

It's an interesting dram.  It's got great balance between the peat and sweetness, which leans me towards a Highland Park of some variety.  There's smoke, but without any of the Islay flavour whatsoever; this is not coastal peat or water here.  I thought at first it might be PC8, but I compared to a bottle I have open right now and found substantial differences in the attack and finish.

So Msheinberg, let fly!

**Rating: 86/100**
