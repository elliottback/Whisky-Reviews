**Teaninich 10 Year Old Cadenhead Small Batch / 55.1%**

*Tasted neat*

[This 10 Year Old Teaninich](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/142536/teaninich-2009-ca) is 55.1% ABV, from a Cadenhead's vatting of 3 hogsheads, yielding 876 bottles.  It is cask strength, natural color, and non-chill-filtered.  The back imprint has some of their notes:

> Nose: Walnuts, green apples, freshly cut wood
> 
> Palate: Nutiness continues with caramelised banana and pinecones.
> 
> Finish: Brown sugar, cinnamon, and a slight lemon zest.

* **Color:** 0.6 (old gold)
* **Nose:** sunshine, green apple skins, flowers, and nautical ropes
* **Taste:** Lots of banana, brulee, custard, and oaky pecans 
* **Finish:** medium, pistachio that turns to lemon

This is fantastically satisfying; despite it's youth it's full of flavour, quite zesty.  Age statements matter very little on good whisky!

**Rating: 7/10**
