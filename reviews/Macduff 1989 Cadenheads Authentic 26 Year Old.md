**Macduff 1989 Cadenhead's Authentic 26 Year Old / 51% / Â£120**

*Tasted neat, then with a bit of bottled water*

[This MacDuff](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/72554/macduff-1989-ca) was distilled in 1989 and bottled in 2015, at 26 years old, from a sherry butt.  It gave up 414 bottles, and the label does not give much more information beside assurances of NCF/cask strength!

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** sulphur, Marlboro reds, bourbon; black pepper and cured ham
* **Taste:** dried figs, dry leather, butter; malty gunpowder and pine sap 
* **Finish:** oloroso dry sherry, sweetness, tannins, and oak

Despite being only 51% strength, this absolutely needs a bit of water to open up.  It's a sherry bomb in the worst (best!) way; super-dry, super heavy, and sulphured.

This is not to everyone's taste, but I like it; it's not boring, and you feel the age of it properly. 

**Rating: 85/100**
