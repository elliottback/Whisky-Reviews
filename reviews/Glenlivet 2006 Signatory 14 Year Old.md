**Glenlivet 2006 Signatory 14 Year Old / 62.9%**

*Tasted neat, then with a little bottled water*

[This Glenlivet](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/179344/glenlivet-2006-sv) from Signatory Vintage's Cask Strength Collection was distilled on 10/17/2006, left to mature for fourteen years in a first-fill sherry butt #901006, and bottled on 2/15/2021.  Mine is bottle 664 of 666.  Of course it is non-chill filtered and natural colour.

* **Color:** burnished (1.1)
* **Nose:** apples, white grape, burnt rubber, sulphur; with water, moss and mildew
* **Taste:** oloroso sherry, muted mixed berry, some oak; lemon cake and cola
* **Finish:** short: sweetness, pine sap, and oak; some citrus zest

This is somewhere in an unhappy middle between a sherry-bomb and an ex-bourbon Glenlivet.  It drinks well, but it could probably do with a few more years to rest since the area-of-contact in those massive sherry butts is rather low.

**Rating: 5/10**
