**Beagle Batch 1 / 66.6% / Sample**

*Tasted with a bit of filtered tap water*

As far as I can tell, this is from [Heartwood Malt Whisky in Tasmania](https://www.heartwoodmaltwhisky.com.au/16-website/57-the-beagle-2), which is an experimental vatting of seven barrels (Bourbon/Port/Sherry/Peated/etc) bottled at Devil's Strength.  The list price was $299 AUD / 500ml bottle, and the underlying distilleries for the blend are unknown Tasmanian ones.  Only 85 bottles made available.

* **Color:** Auburn
* **Nose:** bourbon, oranges & cherries, carrot cake and shaved lemon peel and a little chlorine hot tub vapour
* **Taste:** warm and spicy cake, a little hot, thick molasses; resinous tannins
* **Finish:** extremely long, sweet, with some pipe tobacco and cream

This is pretty good, but very straightforward hot-climate whisky.  I am guessing they had some casks that they couldn't put to good use as a single malt, and thought why not combine their powers?

It's a bit like Monkey Shoulder with punch.

**Rating: 80/100**
