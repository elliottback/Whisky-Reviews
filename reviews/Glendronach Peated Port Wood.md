**Glendronach Peated Port Wood / 46.0% / $80?**

*Tasted neat*

This Glendronach is smoked with highland peat and then finished in Douro Valley port pipes. 

* **Color:** russet (1.3)
* **Nose:** dirty highland peat, sea urchin gone off, bacterial cultures, vinegar   
* **Taste:** a bit of sweetness and fruit, blueberry pie, hot alcohol 
* **Finish:** peat peat peat dirty boggy highland peat 

I don't like this at all; the port finish is barely noticeable, the spirit is super young, and the peat they used is revolting.  Closest comparable dram would be the West Cork Port Finish.

**Rating: 45/100**
