**Laphroaig 10 Year Old Sherry Oak Finish / 48%**

*Tasted neat*

Not much is known about the [Laphroaig 10 Sherry Oak Finish](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/178663/laphroaig-10-year-old) except that it spent some unknown period of time finishing in Oloroso sherry casks.  I would guess 6-12 months?  It is bottled at a higher 48%, which is nice, but the cost in Japan is extortionate; Â¥14,000 or thereabouts.

* **Color:** burnt umber (1.7)
* **Nose:** pine needles, iodine, acetone, dry sherry, cornbread, and caramel
* **Taste:** sappy pine, a kind of spicy sherry; iodine, a little peat; stewed plum and pickled ginger
* **Finish:** medium; a little sweet, peaty, with some icing sugar and cinnamon

Quite darker than the pure ex-bourbon 10 year CS, these sherry casks have done some work here.  Unfortunately, this comes in about three different layers that I don't think are married long enough: the very piney top layer, a dry sherried layer, and then a classic Laphroaig 10 layer.

I am not including the price as part of my scoring, even though I think it's a little on the higher side.  My problem with this, and a lot of finishes in general, is that if not managed carefully, they can disenhance the original quality of the spirit.  I don't think someone who loves Laphroaig will love this.
