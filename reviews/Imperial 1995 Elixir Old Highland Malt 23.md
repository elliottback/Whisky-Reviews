**Imperial 23 1995 Elixir "Old Highland Malt" / 48.2%**

*Tasted neat*

[This Imperial](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/154859/imperial-1995-eld) is a bit mysterious--it's a 23 year old, single cask, and that's all that we know from the bottle.  For Japan market.

* **Color:** deep copper
* **Nose:** heather, cream, drying whitelime, apricot
* **Taste:** buttermilk, almond-tofu dessert, salted cripsy bacon; pears
* **Finish:** long, oak and sweet crème brûlée

The previous Imperial at 17 years was nice, but 6 years and cask-strength does quite a lot for it, it's infinitely more complex and has a really lovely round, rich mouthfeel.

**Rating: 89/100**
