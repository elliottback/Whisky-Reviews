**Glenlivet 13 Year Taiwan Exclusive Oloroso Sherry Cask / 40%**

*Tasted neat*

[This is a fairly dark looking Glenlivet](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/106080/glenlivet-13-year-old) Taiwan exclusive done up in "rare oloroso" sherry casks, and bottled at the bare minimum 40% ABV, surely chill-filtered.  It may even be coloured!  The batch code on the back is 2019/09/10 14:45 LPCN 1281.

* **Color:** old oak (1.8)
* **Nose:** underneath dunnage funk and rich sherry; bubblegum, caramel, and blackberries
* **Taste:** pine, dry and somewhat thin sherry, vanilla cream, and fudge 
* **Finish:** medium; wild cherries and coffee

This has all the promise of a truly knockout dram, but it's crippled by the low ABV.  If you can find it for a reasonable price, by all means, it is a nice slow sipper.  But, you'll be disappointed with the ghosts of flavours more obvious in higher-proof offerings.

**Rating: 81/100**
