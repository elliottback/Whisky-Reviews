**Tormore 1988 Cadenhead Small Batch 30 Year Old / 47.9% / â‚¬200**

*Tasted neat*

Another new distillery to me, [this Tormore](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/127935/tormore-1988-ca) was distilled in 1988 and bottled in 2019 at 30 years old from 3 bourbon hogsheads, for 462 bottles.  This is another ingredient in Chivas blends.  The bottle tasting notes are:

    Nose: Earthy, stewed fruits and caramel
    Palate: Toffee ice cream, butterscotch, and pine nuts
    Finish: Lemon Thyme, gooseberries, and lemongrass

* **Color:** old gold (0.6) 
* **Nose:** plums, caramel, candlewax, and leather
* **Taste:** custard, grass, and dry white wine
* **Finish:** chalk then tannic oak 

This is very very dry, minerally whiskey, and it's not bad, but it's not rich or sumptuous, and tastes mostly like raisins and cardboard when I add even a little water.  I'm having a lot of difficulty with this one, especially as it's not even a single cask, it must be at least somewhat representative of Tormore.

**Rating: 81/100**
