**Review: K&L Bunnahabhain 22yr / 43.3%**

*Tasted neat*

This was aged in oak casks from 1989 for 22 years, and bottled for K&L as part of their Exclusive Malts line.  It is a single cask, no 5712, and one of 258 bottles.

This is one of Islay's less appreciated distilleries, and **I AM IN THE MOOD FOR PEAT**.

* **Color:** light blonde
* **Nose:** whipping cold wind, salt spray, kelpy iodine, fraying rope and peat & rotting meat
* **Taste:** honeysuckle and pepper jerky, pumpkin pie, orange peel
* **Finish:** a quick dry blast of smoke, lingering custard, peaty to the end--sparkly oak

This is a malt more complex than I am capable of appreciating, but to my current preferences it's tasty and interesting.  This is my second Bunna review, but I'm looking forward to trying more of these in the future!

**Rating: 91/100**
