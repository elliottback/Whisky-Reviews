**Port Charlotte 12 / 58.7%**

*Tasted with a bit of filtered tap water*

This is the new 12 year old "standard range" which I am excited about, as it should mean cheap, plentiful Port Charlotte for all to enjoy!

* **Color:** muddy, brown gold
* **Nose:** light peat, alcohol, creme brulee
* **Taste:** rough but smokey, sweet grapes, quite oaky, oily and thick, leather
* **Finish:** long, with ice cream, burnt sugar, peat

I quite like it!  Not quite as much as the PC8, which is my personal fav, but it's nice and I will be buying more bottles :D

**Rating: 90/100**
