**Kavalan Solist Port Cask O090619035A / 57.1%**

*Tasted neat*

[This Kavalan](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/173800/kavalan-solist) single cask is bottle 131 of 185, matured in a port cask for an unknown length of time.  It's natural color, cask strength, and non-chill filtered.  You can still buy [a bottle](https://www.acornsquare.jp/SHOP/KA17049-31.html) in Japan!

* **Color:** old oak (1.8) 
* **Nose:** acetylene, shoe polish, tree sap, lemon rind, and burnt molasses
* **Taste:** dry port wine, pine and cedar, rhubarb pie, wine mulled with spices, and jam
* **Finish:** long, quite oaky; anise, clay, and dried fruits

All of the Kavalan wine casks that I've had the pleasure to try from the Solist range have been beastly, and this is no exception.

**Rating: 87/100**
