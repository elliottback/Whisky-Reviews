**Glenlivet Nadurra OLO615 / 60.3%**

*Tasted neat / with a drop of water*

[This](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/72223/glenlivet-ndurra-oloroso-matured) is a first-fill ex-Oloroso NAS from Glenlivet, batch number OLO615 in the long running Nadurra (natural) series.  It is fortunately bottled at cask strength and with natural color and no chill-filtration.

* **Color:** chestnut (1.2)
* **Nose:** sour cream, burnt plastic, green grapes; industrial solvents
* **Taste:** molasses, some sulphur, vanilla; tea-tree oil, croissants
* **Finish:** medium; strawberry icecream

This has a nice punch to it, but it's quite young, more like "sherry flavoured" than Oloroso matured.  That said, it remains truer to Glenlivet's lighter, fruity style to still be enjoyable.

**Rating: 79/100**
