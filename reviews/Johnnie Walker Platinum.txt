**Johnnie Walker Platinum / 40%**

*Tasted neat*

This is an 18-year old blend introduced this year by Diageo, replacing the Gold Label (a whisky I haven't appreciated, as it's way overoaked, like Dalmore 12).  The mood is *Deltron 3030*.

Do I have to drink this?  Yes, I guess...

* **Color:** caramel colouring[, bitch.](/spoiler)
* **Nose:** toffee, vanilla, clover and marshmallow; not a hint of peat.  some toluene and lemon.
* **Taste:** hoooly oak batman. a bit of woody pepper.
* **Finish:** there wasn't one

I see no reason to ever buy this, it's outrageously thin.  If they could legally sell 30% scotch, I bet they would.  I feel the base of most of this is neutral grain spirit :(

**Rating: 35/100**
