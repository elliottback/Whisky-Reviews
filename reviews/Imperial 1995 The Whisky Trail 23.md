**Imperial 23yr 1995 - The Whisky Trail / 52.7% ABV**

*Tasted with a drop of bottled water*

Just 173 bottles of [this ex-bourbon barrel #7859 Imperial](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/168512/imperial-1995-eld), distilled in 1995 and bottled in 2019 at 23 years old.  This is again a Japan-exclusive, bottled for Whisk-e, but with a much stronger ABV at cask strength then the '94 25 year old I tried from this series.   

* **Color:** burnished (1.1) 
* **Nose:** raw pears, musk, cantaloupe, honeysuckle; cut grass and lime juice
* **Taste:** butterscotch, cream, some butyric acid; sparkling lemonade and foamed milk
* **Finish:** medium, very sweet; vanilla

Not bad, this Imperial; a very light and floral dram with some of the classic creaminess showing up!

**Rating: 81/100**
