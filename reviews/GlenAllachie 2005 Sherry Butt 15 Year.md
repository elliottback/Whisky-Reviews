**GlenAllachie 2005 Sherry Butt 15 Year Old / 63%**

*Tasted neat, then with a drop of mineral water*

The rather-mysterious label of [this single-cask GlenAllachie](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/181253/glenallachie-2005) tells me it was distilled on 25.10.2005, raked into undisclosed sherry butt #901042, and bottled on ??.02.2021 having aged for 15 years.  This is bottle 407 of 523.  Sherry-type aside, we do get nice non-chill filtered (NCF) and natural colour designators.  It does *not* state that it is cask strength, but the only other absurdity on the label, the whopping 63.0% ABV, is surely cask strength.

I want to know if this is PX/Oloroso/Ruby or something else, and Mr. Billy Walker usually tells us!

The bottle notes read:

    COLOUR: Rich Mahogany.
    NOSE: Mocha, vanilla and molasses, with cocoa, almonds, nutmeg and ginger.
    TASTE: Layers of dark chocolate, treacle and mocha, with cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and orange zest.

* **Color:** old oak (1.8)
* **Nose:** sour cream, oak planks, ethanol; musty/humid petrichor, corn chowder soup 
* **Taste:** cinnamon, milk chocolate, cracked leather; dried figs
* **Finish:** long, orange peel and dry, tannic plums -- hint of butyric acid

Having tasted this now, I think it's definitely been slammed with a wet Oloroso cask.

This is a seriously good sherry bomb; it's meaty and robust, contains lots of interesting flavours and notes, and isn't a dud/over-sulphured cask.  It just works, so keep the magic coming, Billy!

**Rating: 92/100**
