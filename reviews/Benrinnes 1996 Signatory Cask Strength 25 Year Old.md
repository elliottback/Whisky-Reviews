**Benrinnes 1996 Signatory Cask Strength 25 Year Old / 53.2%**

*Tasted neat*

[This Benrinnes](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/206189/benrinnes-1996-sv) is a vatting of two ex-bourbon hogsheads 11712 and 11716, distilled on 28/10/1996 and bottled on 18/01/2022 at 25 years of age.  The yield is a stunning 537 bottles! 

* **Color:** russet (1.3)
* **Nose:** green apples, barley, some honey, vanilla, and caramel
* **Taste:** spice, oaky lemon, citrus fruits, minerally peach, and honey
* **Finish:** short but sweet

The ABV on these hogshead is a little higher than I'd expect, and a bit less cask-influence than I'd want at 25 years, but this is good ex-bourbon Benrinnes.

**Rating: 5/10**
