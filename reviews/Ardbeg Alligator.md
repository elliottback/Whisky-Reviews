**Ardbeg Alligator / 51.2% ABV / NCF**

*tasted neat, then with bottled water*

Another Arbeg beastie, this 2011 reptile is 60% 10yr / 40% 10yo matured in [heavily charred bourbon barrels](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=TTPKJMMW3a0).  The burnt barrels look like alligator hide, and the packaging has a raised texture hide pattern on the front.  I'm reviewing the UK 70cl bottle here, let's see how she does!

* **Color:** lighter than I expected, apple juice
* **Nose:** S'mores, honey-mustard BBQ pork, brine, a bit of chlorine
* **Taste: Canadian bacon, honeyed smoke, charred meat on peaty skewers
* **Finish:** wood-fired grill, savory bbq, aggressive chocolate sweetness

It's like eating Jean Georges' chicken--it's amazing, but it's still chicken.  I love the concept of overchar, and the marketing is brilliant.  A limited release worth tasting if you run into it, but less robust and memorable than Uigeadail.  If you have to take the edge off an Ardbeg 10yr, better to do it with a NAS sherry.  However, fans of **extreme smokiness** will love this.  It's delicious and drinkable, but once you get over the initial novelty of the flavour profile, lacking significant depth.

**Rating: 89/100**
