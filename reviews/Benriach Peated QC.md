**Benriach Peated Quarter Casks / 46% / ¥‎7680**

*Tasted with a bit of filtered Tokyo tap water*

This Benriach NAS is aged wholey in quarter casks, but comes out with a very fine straw colour, so I'm guessing that it's natural-colour (it doesn't say) and youngish.  It's bottled at 46%, so it's a bit jumped up from the regular 43%, but nowhere near cask strength!  My favourite Benriach is the port-aged Solstice2, it's delicious!  

How does this stack up? Laphroaig QC is my daily dram; I love a good QC!

* **Color:** straw, like an 8 yro Caol Ila
* **Nose:** peaty, burnt charcoal, syropy pears, ice cream, diesel
* **Taste:** oaky and sweet, with iodine and peat bursting to the top, a hint of pineapple
* **Finish:** long, sweet, thick, and smokey

Delicious.
