**Glenburgie 2013 Carn Mor 7 Year Old / 47.5%**

*Tasted neat*

This [baby Glenburgie](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/171261/glenburgie-2013-mswd) was distilled in 2013 and bottled in 2020, with a Sauternes wine finish.  7 years old, it yielded 607 bottles for  Morrison Scotch Whisky Distillers's *Càrn Mòr Strictly Limited Edition* label.  It is non-chill filtered and natural colour, although potentially not cask strength at 47.5%.

* **Color:** deep gold (0.8)
* **Nose:** ethanol, graham crackers, floral, mint, and white sugar
* **Taste:** herbaciously floral, ginger tea, toffee, toasted oak, and green tea
* **Finish:** long, some fresh-cut grass, bubblegum, and vanilla

Age is not the only factor in a quality whisky, and this young Glenburgie is a lovely testament to excellent distillate.  The sauternes wine-cask finish only sweetens the deal!

**Rating: 87/100**
