**Highland Park 2007 Watt Whisky Electric Coo 14 Year / 54% ABV**

*Tasted neat*

Campbeltown Whisky Company under their imprint "Watt Whisky" have released a [new 14 year old Highland Park](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/196560/an-orkney-distillery-2007-cwcl), styled "An Orkney Distillery" for the *Electric Coo* series, which boasts some punchy cask-strength drams in eye-popping whimsical labels.

This bottle was distilled in March 2007, laid in a single ex-sherry hogshead for 14 years, and bottled.  The back label has a bit of back-and-forth:

> **Brain's Choice:**  In this version of 'Not Scapa' we have quite a bit going on.  Lip-smacking fruitiness (think more of a fruit 'compote' than of say Juicy Fruits) with a hint of 'Highland' Heather (the plant, not Locklear) and a subtle whiff of smoke - like the morning after the rain has put out the bonfire from the night before.  They all go hand in hand, hand in hand through their 'Park' life.

> **Pinky's Rebuttal:** The Sherry maturation works so well - rich fruitiness with a bone dry finish.  Did you know that shark attacks only happen you're wet?  Luckily this needs no water at all.  I don't know why Brain was allowed to pick this as it's actually rather good.  If only we knew which distillery this from... give us a clue, just a ball 'Park' area (maybe in a 'Highland' field) would do...

> "We're going to need a bigger glass"

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** fruit pastry, cigar ash, rich sherry, blackberries, and molasses
* **Taste:** blackberries, walnuts and almonds, stewed strawberry, sherry, chocolate cake, and caramel
* **Finish:** medium but pleasant, dry, and rich as rum

*This* is what Highland Park should be putting into those Viking-themed bottles, not the watered down, offensively inoffensive whisky that goes into their OBs.  Kudos Watt Whisky, this is brilliant!

**Rating: 8/10**
