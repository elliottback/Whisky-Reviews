**Dailuaine 2008 Maltman 15 Year Old / 48%**

*Tasted neat*

[This is the first Dailuaine](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/244169), and it's a nice bottling from The Maltman, single cask #7712 distilled April 2008 and bottled June 2023, making it 15 years old, entirely aged in a Barrique.  It was diluted to 48% to yield 273 bottles, specially selected from Scotch Malt Sales Japan.  It is also non-chill-filtered and natural colour.

The back label has these tasting notes:

> The nose has some sherry notes with hints of honey and clove.
> 
> The palate is smooth and warming with dark chocolate, some banana loaf and crunchy brown sugar.
> 
> Expect some nutty notes coming through with a little milky coffee. A warm finish with sweet sultanas and custard with salted caramel and buttered brioche.

* **Color:** 1.3 (russet)
* **Nose:** sherry, honey, nutmeg, and cardboard
* **Taste:** mead, chocolate brownies, egg custard, and coca cola
* **Finish:** short, a hint of strawberry tart and cream

Inoffensively pleasant, it reminds me a little bit of Oban.  The sherry is not doing much here, it's definitely not first-fill.  I would be open to trying more Dailuaine in the future; this particular single cask is not partically complex.

**Rating: 5/10**
