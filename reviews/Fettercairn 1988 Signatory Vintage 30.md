**Fettercairn 1988 Signatory Vintage 30 / 54.5%**

*Tasted neat, then with some bottled mineral water*

[This Fettercairn](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/130948/fettercairn-1988-sv) from Signatory's lovely Cask Strength Collection was distilled 07.12.1988 and bottled 11.02.2019 yielding 403 bottles from hogsheads 2035 and 2041.  Mine is bottle number 34.  As always, it's natural colour and without chill-filtration.

* **Color:** yellow gold (0.55)
* **Nose:** wet, sodden turf and rotting leaves, lemons, burnt plastic; lemon-meringue pie, margaritas  
* **Taste:** chocolate covered strawberries, honey-glazed ribs, mint; bacon-caesar chicken salad, black pepper
* **Finish:** long, a bit odd, with damp grass; with water, long and soothing with apple

This one definitely needs some water to open up, and a lot of the extremely vegetal/plastic notes recede into the background.  It has nice mouthfeel and texture, but it does lose a point for some off notes, and also being a bit all-over-the-place in terms of palate.

**Rating: 87/100**
