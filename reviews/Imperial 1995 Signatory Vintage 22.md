**Imperial 1995 Signatory Vintage 22 Year Old / 53.1%**

*Tasted neat*

Specially selected and bottled for *The Nectar* in Belgium, [this 1995 Imperial](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/103240/imperial-1995-sv#whisky-note-holder) was distilled on 18.09.1995 and bottled at cask strength on 03.10.2017, from Hogshead 50253.  This is bottle 161 of 219, and this is also natural colour and cask strength.

* **Color:** deep gold (0.8)
* **Nose:** hay, wet grass, cream, lemon meringue, honeysuckle, and grape
* **Taste:** oaky and creamy; cut grass, apricots, ice cream, lemon, and a hint of white pepper
* **Finish:** long, fruity, with more oak, honey, and kiwifruit

I am very fond of these 1995 Imperials, and they continue to not disappoint, even though they are becoming quite scarce, with new entrants on the market massively marked up compared the bottles of yore...

If you can find it at a reasonable price, it's a smashing ex-bourbon Lowlands dram!

**Rating: 8/10**
