**Blair Athol 2004 "The Old Malt Cask" 15 Year / 50%**

*Tasted neat*

[This Blair Athol](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/171956/blair-athol-2004-hl) from Hunter Laing's "The Old Malt Cask" series was distilled 10/2004, aged for 15 years in sherry butt HL17601, and bottled 09/2020 yielding 660 bottles.  This particular series offers some concessions to consumers; it is watered to 50% strength uniformly, and does not have individual bottle numbering.

Label notes are as follows:

    NOSE: strawberries, plums, and toffee
    PALATE: Rhubarb crumble, pepper, and spice
    FINISH: long, with a lingering fruit finish

* **Color:** burnished (1.1)
* **Nose:** apple pie, fresh cream, pastry crust, and candlewax
* **Taste:** boston cream doughnuts, fruit salad, a little pepper, and malty sherry
* **Finish:** medium, but sweet; fresh-baked egg tarts

Amazingly fruity, would buy again!

**Rating: 92/100**
