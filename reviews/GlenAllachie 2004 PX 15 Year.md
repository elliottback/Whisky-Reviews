**GlenAllachie 2004 PX Single Cask 15 Year Old / 58.6%**

*Tasted neat*

Previously we took a look at a pre-Billy Walker era GlenAllachie, but today [we have this](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/167652/glenallachie-2004) Billy Special--a very wet ex-PX single cask, from the colour.  Distilled 08.10.04, this is bottle 060/319 bottled in February of 2020 for Japan's Whisk-E LTD at 15 years old from PX hogshead #4133.

Of course, natural colour, and non-chill-filtered cask strength.

* **Color:** mahogany (1.6)
* **Nose:** rich, stewed berries and plums, a hint of Hermes Le Jardin perfume, cinnamon roll and fruit tarte; graham crackers
* **Taste:** intensely sweet, pine sap, chocolate, honey-roasted pork, and fennel
* **Finish:** oily, extremely long, with sandalwood and black pepper; vanilla icing

There's a massive amount of sopping wet sherry cask influence going on here--but critically, it's not over the top; the spirit is clean and aged nicely, thanks to the smaller size of the hogshead.  Punchy ABV, but very sweet.  If you don't favour sugary, almost cognac-like, sherry bombs, this one should be a skip for you.

**Rating: 91/100**
