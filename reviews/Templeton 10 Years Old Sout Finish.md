**Templeton 10 Year Old Reserve Single Barrel / 52%**

*Tasted neat*

Today let's take a quick look at two American Ryes from brand Templeton.  Introduced in 2006, this Rye is distilled in Indiana by MGP (formerly Lawrenceburg Distillers of Indiana) from a mash bill of 95% rye and 5% barley.

* **Color:** mahogany (1.6)
* **Nose:** ethanol, christmas spice, burnt wood, honey, and tobacco
* **Taste:** warm and oily, cedar, vanilla ice cream, rye, and peppermint
* **Finish:** long, icing sugar, more spice; whipped cream

I know this is MGP, but this is quite delicious.  The higher proof brings out a little more texture, and the flavours are simple but enjoyable.

**Rating: 7/10**

**Templeton Stout Cask Finish Limited Release / 46%**

*Tasted neat*

* **Color:** burnt umber (1.7)
* **Nose:** turpentine, licorice, bubble gum, and leather
* **Taste:** plastic, licorice, soap, and spice
* **Finish:** medium; stout comes through at the end

Unfortunately, the finish is not enough to save this NAS, which I think could do well from a little more time resting in wood.
