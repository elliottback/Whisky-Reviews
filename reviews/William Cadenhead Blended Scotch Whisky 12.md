**William Cadenhead Blended Scotch Whisky 12 / 46.0% / $60?**

*Tasted neat*

[This whisky](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/128802/william-cadenhead-12-year-old-ca) is Batch 8 of a 12 year blend; it contains whiskey from Glenfarclas, Miltonduff, and Invergordon (plus presumably more).

* **Color:** brown sherry (1.9)
* **Nose:** plums, sherry, peaches, pipe smoke
* **Taste:** butter, cream, sherry, cashew, roasted yams
* **Finish:** long and warming

I am very regularly disappointed in blends, but I am also a sucker for interesting labels, and the 70s style bottle label intrigued me.  That and the good experience I've had with Cadenhead's single cask/small batch products in the past.

This is an excellent sherried blend.

**Rating: 90/100**
