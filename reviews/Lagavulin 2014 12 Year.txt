**Lagavulin 12 Year - 2014 / 54.4% / $90?**

*Tasted with a bit of filtered water*

I was pretty excited that I found an  older bottling of Lagavulin 12 CS in Taiwan last December, so here today we have [the 14th release from 2014](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/58219/lagavulin-12-year-old).  Also yes, the front fell off.  The glue holding the labels on is gone and passed away :(

This was one of my favourite whiskies before I moved to Japan in 2015, and I rated the 2010 vintage a 98.  I have been less impressed with recent offerings (2015-2018); they seem tired compared to the old juice.

* **Color:** white sand
* **Nose:** pure iodine and peat to the face, hot alcohol, some fermenting pineapple, and crushed black pepper
* **Taste:** just like the nose, but with apple pie, kippers, and a lovely oily mouthfeel
* **Finish:** long and smokey vanilla ice cream

The 2014 Lagavulin 12 absolutely stands up to my memories of it--it's got a really refined, pure approach with the peat, and it tastes the cleanest Islay I've had the pleasure of trying.  I have a bottle of the 2019 special releases to try, but I haven't cracked it yet, so here's hoping the boat begins to turn.

**Rating: 95/100**
