**Glendronach 18 Tawny Port Finish / 46% ABV / $150**

*Tasted Neat*

So this is an 18 year old matured mostly in European Oak and then transferred to some small number of ex-Tawny Port (my favourite Port I might say) casks for an unspecified length of time.  The bottle code says it was produced 2014/10/14, and I do not think there are any batches currently on sale.  I purchase this from an auction.

* **Color:** sienna
* **Nose:** a big hit of sulphury sweetness, overcooked icing, blueberry jam, pipe tobacco; Macallan?
* **Taste:** lentils, figs and cake, some vanilla -- actually it's like if you blended desserts for a table of 6 and drank it
* **Finish:** long, warm, and perfect for winter!

If there was such a thing as a high proof Tawny Port, this might be close to it.  As a fan of a nice dessert Port, this turns out like that, but as a single malt, I find it to be extremely muddy in flavour.

**Rating: 70/100**
