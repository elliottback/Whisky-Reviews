**The Three Drinkers 17 Yr Blended Malt No. 1 / 45% / $45**

*Tasted neat*

[This](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/142359/the-three-drinkers-17-year-old) is based on the Amazon Prime TV show "The Three Drinkers" (which I have not watched) and is a non-chill-filtered, natural colour 17 year blended malt.  Mine is bottle 181 of a tiny run of 300, but the way that this is number as "Batch One" leaves hope that there are more to come.  This bottle also features prominently the logo of Cask Trade Ltd, who provided the casks for the blend.

    Inspired by our journey through Scotland, we picked flavour elements to reflect the locations we visited as well as each of our personalities.  The Three Drinkers whisky is fruity and spicy with notes of sweet fudge, dried apricots and a touch of smoky oak.

* **Color:** dark brown
* **Nose:** a little mint, leather sofa, blackberries, and chocolate; burnt matches
* **Taste:** a little smokey-peaty, like there's a bit of Ardbeg mixed with some thick Speymalt casks; brownies with vanilla icecream and mint, lots of sherry
* **Finish:** medium, dry sherry and cacao; oak

I don't often buy blended whisky, but I picked this up because of the amazing colour, the seventeen year age statement, and the price!  It's thoroughly enjoyable, a nice buffed +5% ABV, and for a blended malt, quite complex.

**Rating: 86/100**
