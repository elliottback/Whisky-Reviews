**Kilchoman Fino Sherry Cask / 46%**

*Tasted neat*

[This is a](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/166153/kilchoman-fino-sherry-matured) large but limited 2020 Kilchoman release of 10,500 bottles that were vatted from 12 ex-Fino Sherry casks from Bodega Miguel Martin in Spain.  The bottle tasting notes are:

    Nose: Maritime peat smoke, ripe banana, syrupy sweetness with a hint of nuttiness
    Palate: Tropical fruit, earthy peat smoke with bitter chocolate and zesty lemons
    Finish: Bold layers of damp peat smoke, walnuts, brine and lasting richness

* **Color:** deep gold (0.85)
* **Nose:** classic kilchoman; straw hay, peat smoke, iodine, creosote, honey, and vanilla
* **Taste:** minerally peat, barnyard horses and sunshine, sour cream, spices, and pineapple  
* **Finish:** more peat, salt, and dark chocolate

I'm not getting a huge influence from the Fino casks; this is mostly to me just another classic Kilchoman.

**Rating: 85/100**
