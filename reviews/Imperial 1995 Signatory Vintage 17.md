**Imperial 17 1995 Signatory Vintage / 46% / $160**

*Tasted neat*

Another Signatory Imperial from the 'Un-Chillfiltered Collection', which usually releases at 46%, so unfortunately not cask strength.  This Imperial is 17 years old, distilled on 21.08.1995 and bottled 15.03.2013 from Hogsheads 50129 and 50130, bottle number 237 of 793 total.

This bottle suffered a dry cork, but it was easy to replace with a loaner and it didn't fall apart enough to prevent me corkscrewing it.  The glued-on topcap also had deteriorated!

* **Color:** old gold (0.65)
* **Nose:** lighter fluid, acorns, raspberry, mojito, and burnt rubber
* **Taste:** thick & oily texture; grassy butter, fish-cakes, tabasco, dessert tart, gunpowder
* **Finish:** very long, vanilla icecream, a little oak

This younger Imperial still has some rough notes to work off, but I like it!

**Rating: 86/100**
