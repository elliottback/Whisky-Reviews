**Benriach The Twelve / 46%**

*Tasted neat*

Part of Benriach's rebrand, ["The Twelve"](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/165512/benriach-12-year-old) is a new 12 year old part of their staple lineup, matured in ex-Sherry, Bourbon, and Port casks.  The label promises no smoke, and a "maple honey, coca, forest fruits" nose with a "maraschino cherry, baked orange, hazelnut, spiced mocha" palate.  The label also notes that this is the production of their master blender, Rachel Barrie.  

I can't make out the bottle date, I think it's 2020/12/03.

* **Color:** chestnut (1.2)
* **Nose:** butter, hot nail polish, baked apple, caramel, and lilac
* **Taste:** soft sherry, some sweet grape, mikan honey, and oily tannin
* **Finish:** warm, long, but somewhat thin and acidic; minerally; cardboard

Although this is priced very affordably, and rings in at a warm 46%, it feels quite hot.  The blending is excellent, there's no war between casks going on here, which saves this from a 3 rating.  It's not something that I would keep regularly stocked.

**Rating: 4/10**
