**Ardmore 2010 BlackAdder Raw Cask 11 Year Old / 60.1% ABV**

*Tasted neat, then with a little mineral water*

Next up is a [single cask Ardmore](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/197812/ardmore-2010-ba) from BlackAdder under their "Raw Cask" line, meaning the bottle is not only un-chill-filtered, but not filtered at all and has cask residues.  Distilled at Ardmore distillery on 30th June 2010, this is just one of 90 bottles drawn at Cask Strength from barrel no 803497, bottled in August 2021.  Mine is bottle #78.

* **Color:** amber (0.7)
* **Nose:** lemon zest, ethanol, tropical fruits, parfume, hints of peat; smoked candied lemon, sea spray
* **Taste:** minerality, sharp bright pear, peat, straw; cream cake, guava
* **Finish:** medium-long, a little tart; with water, sweet oakiness

This is very distillate-forward, much like the previous Watt-whisky 11 year old, but the cask here is a little bit more active and provides some vanilla and oak.  With the strength here, a dash of water doesn't drown the spirit and brings out more complexity to enjoy.  

Excellent.

**Rating: 8/10**
