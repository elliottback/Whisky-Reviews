**Glenturret 10 Years Old / 40%**

*Tasted neat*

There is very little here on this bottle besides "Glenturret 10 Years Old Single Malt Scotch Whisky", aside from the following marketing statements:

* Scotland's Oldest Working Distillery
* By Hand and by Heart
* Product of Scotland
* Small Batch

Let's see how it tastes!

* **Color:** russet (e150a)
* **Nose:** ethanol, green apple, some stewed plum; honey, nail polish
* **Taste:** light and floral; pastry crust, osmanthus, vanilla, and jasmine
* **Finish:** long, some honey, cut grass; and ginger

The nose has a few off notes, but is not largely unpleasant; on tasting it is well-bodied and somewhat oily, with a light and floral character.  Compared the "Sherry cask" batches that came out previously that I tried, this is a very respectable Highland malt and they're really turning quality around!

**Rating: 5/10**
