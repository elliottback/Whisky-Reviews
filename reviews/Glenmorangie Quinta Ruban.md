**Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban / 46% / $45**

*Tasted neat*

12 years old, with extra maturation in ruby port casks for a lovely flavour.  Non-chill filtered.

* **Color:** rose
* **Nose:** raspberry, tobacco, plums, rose, alcohol
* **Taste:** oak, ice cream, grass, hint of port, whole-bodied peaches
* **Finish:** long and savoury, salt, cream

Extraordinarily delightful, not overly complex.  I've been trying to get into port-finished scotches since I had the Laphroaig special edition, and this one lives up.  Also, it's amazingly affordable!

**Rating: 91/100**
