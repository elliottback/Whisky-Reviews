**Jameson / 40% ABV / Free 50ml Sample**

*Tasted neat*

This famous "Smooth Irish Whiskey" is "Made The John Jameson Way Since 1780" and boasts being triple distilled.  Not too much to say here, as it's probably one of the best-selling whiskeys in the world and a bar staple.  It is aged for at least 4 years in Oak.

Some kind folks at Tokyo Whiskey Library had been given a bunch of promotional samples and so they just gave me this when I went over for a COVID-19 takeout order.

* **Color:** e150a
* **Nose:** lemon-furniture-polish, burnt sugar, cardamom, ethanol
* **Taste:**  a little richness, leather, oak, and vanilla
* **Finish:** short, some creaminess and mint (!)

This is an inexpensive Irish whiskey designed for mass appeal; it's not complex, it's inoffensive, and it's the perfect cocktail or on-the-rocks whiskey.  And it's very clean distillate, so you have to appreciate that!

**Rating: 67/100**
