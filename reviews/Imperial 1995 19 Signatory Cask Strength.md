**Imperial 1995 19 Signatory Cask Strength / 52.4% / $150**

*Tasted neat*

I've been digging some of the 1995 Imperials recently--this one is Signatory Cask Strength 19 years old, distilled 18/09/1995 and bottled 07/09/2015 in Hogsheads, casks 50211 and 50212, bottle 257 of 378.

All natural, no chill-filtration.

* **Color:** light gold
* **Nose:** bandaids, vanilla, foamed whole milk, tar, spring lilac
* **Taste:** really lush mouthfeel, french pastry, butter and ice cream, rubber grommets
* **Finish:** long, oily with some floral notes

This is pretty much classic '95 Imperial except with weird "fresh out the dyer" rubbery off-notes!

**Rating: 79/100**
