**Camus Josephine Cognac Pour Femme / 40% / 350ml**

*Tasted neat*

This is [an older bottling](https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/p/11205/camus-josephine-cognac-pour-femme) of Cognac from producer Camus, intended to appeal to women.  It features lovely art-nouveau, [Alphonse Mucha's "Evening Contemplation"](https://www.alfonsmucha.org/Evening-Contemplation.-From-The-Times-Of-The-Day-Series.-1899.html) on the label.

The [official page](https://web.archive.org/web/20010914154716/http://www.camus.fr/newgen_a.htm) for this "New Generation" cognac brand was first archived on 15:47:16 Sep 14, 2001, and last appears on the Camus website in 2005. The page describes it as "Joséphine - La Tendresse du Cognac" (in english: "Josephine - The Tenderness of Cognac"):

> First of the 'New Generation' cognacs and the first ever to be created specially for women. A smooth and gentle blend of premium cognacs, delicious on its own or mixed in cocktails. Striking packaging featuring a romantic print from Art Nouveau artist Alphonse Mucha.
> 
> Eye:	LIGHT AMBER COLOUR WITH HINTS OF GOLD.
>
> Nose:	ELEGANT WITH A DOMINANCE OF VANILLA AND A SUBTLE AROMA OF CHESTNUTS.
>
> Taste:	ROUNDED AND SUPPLE WITH NUTTY UNDERTONES AND A SLIGHTLY SWEET FINISH.

Sadly, this cork was in pretty bad shape and crumbled and broke easily.

* **Color:** auburn (1.5)
* **Nose:** spice, oak, grape must, molasses, butter, and toluene
* **Taste:** wide cuts, grape juice, pipe smoke, some orange, vanilla, and syrupy sweetness 
* **Finish:** very long, leather, roasted chestnuts, chewy tannins, and finally chocolate

This has an exquisite finish, which is lovely, but the nose is quite hot, and on the palate there are competing off-notes of spicy woodiness, factory chemical, and glue.

Anyone looking to purchase this in Japan--there are a fair few [bottles on Mercari](https://jp.mercari.com/search?keyword=CAMUS+COGNAC+JOSEPHINE) around ¥2000.

**Rating: 75/100**
