**BlackAdder Smoking Islay 2017 / 58.8%**

*Tasted neat, then with some bottled water*

In my hands is bottle number 5 of 280 from BlackAdder's [Smoking Islay](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/112385/smoking-islay-bottled-2017-ba), a NAS cask strength Islay blend release periodically.  This one is bottled on November 2017.  This is also in their "raw cask" line featuring auspicious particles of cask sediments!  

* **Color:** russet (1.3) although black particulates in the dram make it feel a bit polluted
* **Nose:** huge peat smoke, iodine, lemon-sour, bandaids; some pear
* **Taste:** prickly, salt, seaweed, more peat, honey-glazed BBQ pork; vanilla
* **Finish:** lingering peat, a feeling of hot malt, and lavender

Neat, this is a fiery, rich Islay dram.  You could almost call it "Big Peat" if that moniker were not reserved for a rather thinner blend.  With a little water, some of the brashness is lost and you have got, I think, a solid CS (but very young) mostly Lagavulin. 

**Rating: 88/100**
