**Benromach 2009 Cask Strength Batch 2 / 57.1%**

*Tasted neat / then with mineral water*

[This cask-strength Benromach](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/160603/benromach-2009) is Batch 2, distilled in 2009 and bottled in 2019, imported for Japan by AXAS Co.  These are the distillery's rough replacement for the 100 proof series, and [come in a bewildering](https://malt-review.com/2021/06/23/benromach-cask-strength/) number of slight variations, depending on which target markets you are in.

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** big, sulphury sherry, raisins and dates, caramel, menthol, and burnt corn; with water: tobacco smoke, paint thinner
* **Taste:** rich, fruity and sweet, vanilla and pear; with water: more mealy, some turpentine and white wine
* **Finish:** medium, laphroaig-esque burnt plastic, grape juice; with water: a little acidic

These should be fairly cheap if you managed to pick one up.  Just don't add water!  Cask strength, a blistering 57%, the sherry is robust, and powerful enough to mask a lot of off-notes that become more obvious when diluted.

**Rating: 4/10**
