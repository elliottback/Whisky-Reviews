**Crown Royal Cask No 16 / 40% ABV**

*Tasted neat*

A discontinued Diageo blended Canadian whisky finished in 12-year cognac French oak barrels.  

Crown Royal is most typically mixed with ginger ale, or used as a bomb (this is quite good in PBR).

* **Color:** caramel colouring
* **Nose:** maple, hot rubbing alcohol, brownies
* **Taste:** rye grain, the cognac comes through and it's well integrated, pine oil, some plasticky notes
* **Finish:** popcorn "butter," short

While this wouldn't be my first choice of whisky, it has a nice, light mouthfeel, and the off notes so present in cheap Canadian whisky are muted (a little) thanks to the lovely French oak.

It doesn't taste like much, however, and the finish is quite flat.  Meh.

**Rating: 48/100**
