**Old Pulteney 1990 – Single Cask Bottling for The Official Line / 18 yr / 53.6%**

*Tasted neat & w/bottled water*

A rare 18 year old single-cask, cask strength Old Pulteney bottled for members of *some obscure Australian scotch club* called "The Official Line".

This has been aged its entire life in an [ex-Islay (probably Jura cask)](http://www.whiskyfun.com/archiveoctober08-2.html#201008).

Never tried OP ([the 21 year was named "Best Whisky of the Year" by Jim Murray in 2012](http://www.oldpulteney.com/old-pulteney-whisky/21-year-old-single-malt/)) before, this is a treat!

* **Color:** sunbeams, straw, hematuriatic
* **Nose:** intriguing umami mushrooms, salt fish, alcohol - *w/water:* petrichor
* **Taste:** pear and ginger soup, figs, a touch of oak, light smoke
* **Finish:** long and prickly, sugar snaps, honey

Truly phenom, and I love the Islay hints.

**Rating: 93/100**
