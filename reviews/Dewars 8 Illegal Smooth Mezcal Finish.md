**Dewars 8 Illegal Smooth Mezcal Finish / 40%**

*Tasted neat*

It's Dewar's, but done up with a [Mezcal Cask finish](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/184326/dewars-08-year-old).  The name "Illegal Smooth" is a poke at the scotch whisky association regulations which only recently allowed this cask type for a whisky to be allowed to be called "Scotch whisky".  

Timelines are unknown, but maybe the last six months of marriage are in Mezcal casks.

* **Color:** chestnut (1.2) -- caramel again; I don't get it, I'll drink a light natural-coloured whisky, but I suppose the majors are doing this for a reason
* **Nose:** smokey; a little vinegar, some burnt plastic, salt, tequila, and caraway seed; behind it all, a hint of chlorine
* **Taste:** really rounded, mellow, sherry with some spice and smoke; some bright agave and ice cream
* **Finish:** smokey, but short, with prickly tequila again

Doing up a blend with a *finish* is courageous, and this at least partly delivers on ez-Mezcal cask finishing, which we've seen to great effect now in Lagavulin's Jazz release.  You could consider this an immature, but accessible, version, and I think it's done well enough that people will be able to pick this up and note "wow, here's a whisky with a hint of Patr√≥n."

**Rating: 5/10**
