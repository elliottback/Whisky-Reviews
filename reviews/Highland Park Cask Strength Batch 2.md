**Highland Park Cask Strength Batch 2 / 63.9% ABV**

*Tasted neat*

This 2021 [bottling of Highland Park](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/190042/highland-park-cask-strength) I believe was part of a mandatory bundle I bought to get access to an Akkeshi, and so there are a few things that trouble me about it:

* No age statement (NAS)
* 63.9% ABV implies it is likely quite young
* It wastes money on the embossed viking bottle (but this is very Highland Park)
* The label has absolutely no information on it
* It could be artificially coloured!  Who knows!

That said, the [official listing](https://www.highlandparkwhisky.com/en/cask-strength-release-no2) at least chimes in to add that this is from sherry seasoned European & american oak casks, "along with just a few ex-bourbon casks."  Not sure what that information is really worth.

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** hot, grapey, fennel, lemon, peaches and somewhere--hints of sherry
* **Taste:** mead, a nice oily mouthfeel, green apple, lemon-lime sorbet, some sherry
* **Finish:** medium, some vanilla and icing

This has the potential to be good, but it's too young.  I suppose you know that when you buy NAS; producers using old stock in a vatting usually find some way to hint about it, or even labelling to their youngest, which could be nicely aged itself.

**Rating: 4/10**
