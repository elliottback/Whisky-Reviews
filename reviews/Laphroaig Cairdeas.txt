**Laphroaig Cairdeas / 51.2% / 2012**

*Tasted neat/bottled water*

A celebratory bottling of origin Cairdeas (13-21 yr) with newer Laphroaig spirit from quarter casks, it's a tastier alternative to the regular bottlings.  The name means "Friendship."

> The mood is *Hail Mary* by Young Jeezy on DJ Capcom's *War Strategy 4*

* **Color:** pale post-it notes
* **Nose:** summer breeze lemon-tart and astringent peat, subtle honeysuckle
* **Taste:** full-bodied, slightly oaked Laphroaig.  The QCs are rocking out.  A little water destroys the structure, leaving us with smoke.
* **Finish:** lingering sweetness, slight acidity; short

This is a delicious, lighter, *friendlier* Laphroaig--the Cask strength is essential.  It's unusually pleasant for a single malt that has often garnered accolades like "bandaids", "rubbing alcohol", and "tar."  The cleanness of this malt is improved, but yet nowhere near the Lagavulin 12.

**Rating: 87/100**
