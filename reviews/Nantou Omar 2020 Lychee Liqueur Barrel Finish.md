* **Color:** russet (1.3)
* **Nose:** lychee, vanilla, ethanol, nutmeg, grain whisky, and jasmine flowers
* **Taste:** extremely sweet, lychee, dragonfruit; passionfruit bubble tea
* **Finish:** short, some oak

This is one-of-a-kind _digestif_, probably the only one in the world using locally produced ex-Lychee barrels, and it's sweet, fruity, and inoffensive.  But even though it is technically a single malt, it drinks like a dessert cordial.  I don't think I will stock it regularly, but I wonder if it would make a good highball or spritz.

**Rating: 6/10**
