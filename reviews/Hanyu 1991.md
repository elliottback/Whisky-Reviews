**Hanyu 1991 (Ichiro's Malt 2 of Hearts?) / 56.3% / Sample**

*Tasted neat*

I think I'm excited to try a Hanyu, never had one before but since I'm moving to Japan hopefully I will get to try a few more.

* **Color:** quite light, almost jameson-like
* **Nose:** japanese oak, plums, steamed wood, popcorn and butter
* **Taste:** vanilla cake, grass, cream, tannins, marshmellow
* **Finish:** spice, pepper, long with rosemary, young oak

This is a pleasant, unimposing, reasonable complex Japanese malt that tastes a lot like a Longmorn.

**Rating: 86/100**
