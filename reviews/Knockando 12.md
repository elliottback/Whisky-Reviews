**Knockando 12 / 43%**

*Tasted neat*

My friend gave me this [Knockando 12](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/102384/knockando-12-year-old), the first I've had a Knockando, in an unusual container and with the caveat that it's "not bad".  Let's find out if this is whisky or apple juice.

* **Color:** deep copper (1.0) - definitely caramel colouring here
* **Nose:** lime peels, butyric acid, a little vanilla, and salt 
* **Taste:** shockingly astringent, sherry, botanicals, toothpaste, and currants
* **Finish:** quick, soft, sweet; nothing off

What a combination of intriguing and terrifying!  It comes on very hot initially but quickly settles in the palate, and to my surprise for a budget dram, is pretty refreshing.  This must make great blending stock, and I'd love to see it done up in a proper single cask at cask strength, would be really lovely.

**Rating: 81/100**
