**GlenAllachie 2008 PX Single Cask 12 Year Old / 56.9%**

*Tasted neat*

Moving along from a smaller PX hogshead 15 year to [this 12 Year PX Puncheon](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/171388/glenallachie-2008), we'll try another taste of the Billy Walker "magic".  Distilled 30.06.08 and laid in PX Puncheon #667 for 12 years, this was bottle 243/687, bottled in September 2020, for the UK market.

Sources on the internet say this is a 2-years re-rack, but unfortunately the label offers no indications.  Of course, natural colour, and non-chill-filtered cask strength.

This is [still available for purchase](https://www.abbeywhisky.com/products/glenallachie-12-year-old-2008-cask-667-aw-exclusive) at time of publication.

* **Color:** burnt umber (1.7)
* **Nose:** deep musty forest floor sherry, cinnamon, baked pastry crust, orange peel
* **Taste:** brighter sherry, barbecue brisket ends, some pine, lemon tarts, and beef jerky 
* **Finish:** long and sweet, more orange, and chocolate

This is excellent, it's more balanced than the 15 year ex-PX hogshead I just reviewed; more of the spirit shines through a very clean sherry finish.  Absolutely ace.

**Rating: 93/100**
