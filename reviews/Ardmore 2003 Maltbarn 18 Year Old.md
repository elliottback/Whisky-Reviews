**Ardmore 2003 Maltbarn 18 Year Old / 51.9% ABV**

*Tasted neat*

Moving onto the older category, [this 18 year old Ardmore](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/210335/ardmore-2003-mba) from Maltbarn was distilled in 2003, matured in a sherry cask, and then bottled in 2021 with an outturn of just 122 bottles.

* **Color:** russet (1.3)
* **Nose:** a little smoke, smores, floral; lilacs, ground nutmeg, and clover
* **Taste:** some peat smoke, honey, blackberry, leather, brown sugar, and a hint of citrus
* **Finish:** medium, sweet, with vanilla, and sherry

A lot of the distillery character here has been softened by the sherry, but you end up with a rich, lightly smoked dessert whisky that is undeniably delicious.

**Rating: 7/10**
