**Benrinnes 15 Darkness / 53.3% ABV / $99**

*Tasted with a splash of bottled water*

For my 100^th review I couldn't pass ahead of the queue of seven nearly empties lining up, but fortunately I have one of my favourites, Benrinnes.  This is bottle 64 of 94; unfortunately in a 500ml size.

This specially finished Benrinnes spent three months in a first-fill PX octave ([about 3.5x smaller than a bourbon barrel](http://whiskyscience.blogspot.com/2011/04/cask-sizes.html)).  The significantly greater surface-area to volume of these tiny casks imports more of the sherry into the spirit.

No word on chill filtration or colour.

* **Color:** leathery brown
* **Nose:** cream sherry, earthy hazelnuts, hairspray
* **Taste:** vanilla, fudge, cookie dough, lemons
* **Finish:** long rich, creamy chocolate cake, leather, figs, plum

This is very tasty, rich, and satisfying.  However, some of the sherry elements seem poorly integrated, and a hint of thinness can touch through in places.  You can almost taste two layers.  It's also expensive for 500ml.  

Nonetheless, I like the experiment that Master of Malt tried with the Darkness! series, and I'm looking forward to what they come up with next--hopefully spending a little more time in the finishing casks, and perhaps vatting a number of them together to create a better marriage.

**Rating: 93/100**
