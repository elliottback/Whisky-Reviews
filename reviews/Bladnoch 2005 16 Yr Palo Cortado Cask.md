**Bladnoch 2005 16 Yr Palo Cortado Cask / 51.4%**

*Tasted neat*

[This Bladnoch](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/184232/bladnoch-2005) was distilled in October 2005 and bottled in May 2021, matured in *Palo Cortado* hogshead #1022 and bottled at cask strength.  Mine is #97 of 330 bottles, and I'm very excited about this, because I've been on a bit of a Palo Cortado kick and it's currently my favourite kind of sherry cask.

* **Color:** russet (1.3)
* **Nose:** burnt sugar, grape must, cornbread, vanilla, and rosewater
* **Taste:** rich double-chocolate cake, dry red wine, molasses, orange, and orchids
* **Finish:** long, thick syrop, cardamon, and more honey

This is pretty close to end-game for me; it's fantastically thick, rich in flavour, with a huge finish.  It's definitely for those with a sweet tooth, if you're craving something light and clean, this won't do.  If you think Palo Cortado has a bit of magic, a little mold underneath the marble, this is for you.

**Rating: 96/100**
