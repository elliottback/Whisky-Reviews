**Benriach 1998 Sherry Cask / 16 YR / 56.1% ABV**

*Tasted with a splash of filtered tap water*

This is a limited release from cask 7628, aged 16 years in Pedro Ximenez Sheery Puncheon.  This was distilled in 1998, bottled in March 2015; bottle 71 of 621, possibly exclusive to the Japan market as it has a Whisky-e Ltd printed label on the back in Japanese as opposed to the usual sticker-on-top-of sticker that imported scotch has.

It is cask strength (yay), natural colour, and non-chill-filtered.

* **Color:** brown bear
* **Nose:** sherry, honey-drizzled fruit tart, almost no alcohol; some orange
* **Taste:** tons of sherry, rich cream-cheese, cigar leather, marshmallows, and berry jam
* **Finish:** long and sticky

I quite enjoy this; it's a powerful sherry-heavy single cask.  It reminds me of a more subtle/less sulphury Glenfarclas Family Cask.  I'd buy it again.

**Rating: 90/100**
