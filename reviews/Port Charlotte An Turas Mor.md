**Port Charlotte An Turas Mor / 46% ABV / $60**

*tasted neat, w/bottled water*

Finally!  A scotch that labels as both E150 free and NCF!  

*An Turas Mor* means "The Great Journey", a whisky that Jim McEwan finally believes is good enough for the [resurrected Port Charlotte distillery](http://bit.ly/QE1nx4) to showcase.  Apparently, it's a 2010 multi-vintage vatting **peated to 40ppm** (yum!) and aged in American Oak.  No age statement.

* **Color:** pale layers of rippling sandstone
* **Nose:** rotting peaches and apples past their time, hay and summer sea spray.  Rotting kelp.
* **Taste:** honeysuckle-mustard barbeque glaze, peppered jerky, earthy peat
* **Finish:** oaky warmth and sweetness, longer with a touch of water

I really like An Turas Mor!  It's peaty, floral, with the charred-cask BBQ characteristics we love in Ardbeg Alligator, but less in your face and balanced with perfect sweet notes.  My only complaint might be that it's only 46%--which is **amazingly better than 43% or 40%**--or that there's no notes on what the vattings were that went into making it.  It tastes like a young Kilchoman with the edges rounded off, and I hope Bruichladdich keeps making more of it.  The only thing I can say about this eminently drinkable malt is that it's not nearly as complex as its older, stronger cousins.

**Rating: 87/100**
