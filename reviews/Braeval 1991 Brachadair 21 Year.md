**Braeval 1991 Brachadair 21 Year / 53.1% ABV**

*Tasted neat, then with some mineral water*

This is a bit of an odd combination today; we have [an IB Braeval](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/bottler/77720/brachadair) from a relatively small Belgian producer [Brachadair](https://www.brachadair.com/) which has put out just 14 releases so far since its inception in 2012. 

This Braeval was matured in ex-bourbon barrel #95120 for 21 years, distilled in 08-1991 and bottled 02-2013.  This is a bottle 140 of 230, bottled at cask strength, with no chill-filtering.

The producer notes:

>  I call this our 'two-faced' Speyside : beautifully complex and the palate delivering something you didn't quite expect from the nose. Where the smell prepares you for something very sweet, the spiciness comes as a pleasant surprise. However, after the pepper, the sweetness and a little bit of wood add to the complexity of this little known, and underestimated, but nevertheless sublime malt.
   
    Color: White gold
    Nose: Sweet and waxy, dried grass, coconut milk, ginger and white pepper, lime zest. Oak and vanilla.
    Palate: Slightly waxy mouthfeel but spicyness coming through quickly and very strong. Fruit, coconut. Long finish with hints of woodsmoke. 

* **Color:** amontillado sherry (0.9)
* **Nose:** oak, sour lemons, paraffin, thyme; hay bales and green apple
* **Taste:** oily, cream, candlewax, vanilla, and oak; sawdust and coconut
* **Finish:** long, sweet custard

The first point of praise is the cork; although this bottle is 7 years old, it's not dried out at all.  Quality.  It is very approachable straight, without any water, but with a small drop it opens up a little bit more.  I would honestly recommend no water with this one.

This is an excellent Speyside ex-bourbon 21 year, it's light, slightly fruity, and very creamy. 

**Rating: 90/100**
