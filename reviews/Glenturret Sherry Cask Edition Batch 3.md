**Glenturret Sherry Cask Edition Batch 3 / 43% ABV**

*Tasted neat*

Glenturret is a fairly small Highland distillery, with just 340,000 liters / year of production, and has passed through many parent company owners in the last 40 years, finally landing with the Lalique Group.

Bottled in 2017, the [Glenturret Sherry Cask Edition Batch 3](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/105035/glenturret-sherry-edition) is a NAS single malt made with European & American Oak Sherry Casks.  It almost certainly coloured and chill-filtered, and obviously not cask strength.

* **Color:** tawny (1.4) -- but probably e150a'd
* **Nose:** butyric acid, nail polish, a little bit of Oloroso sherry, stale bread, and ethanol 
* **Taste:** malty-grainy, some sherry and sweetness, caramel; very thin
* **Finish:** I didn't get one, just a little sugar

Where's the whisky?  There's nothing here.  Unfortunately, I think I have all three of the Glenturret single malt releases hiding away to try in the future.  I believe there's a peated one, and one more -- maybe they'll deliver something.

**Rating: 1/10**
