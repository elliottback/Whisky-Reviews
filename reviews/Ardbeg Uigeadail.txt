**Ardbeg Uigeadail / 54.2% ABV / NCF**

*tasted neat, then with a bit of filtered water*

* Color: suprisingly dark, "natural" apple-sauce
* Nose: peat smoke, grilled fish, sherry and lemon
* Taste: charcoal and chocolate, deliciously sharp oak, vanilla
* Finish: my wife thinks I've smoked a Marlboro

What makes the Oog so special?  This one is a marriage of young bourbon-aged (like their 10) scotch with older stuff matured in sherry casks.  So you get the same fiery intensity in young Ardbegs and Laphroaigs but backed with richness and complexity.  It's my long-time favourite in the Ardbeg line, and a bottle I'll always try to keep on hand.

I think it would be a great candidate for a community review down the line!
