**Dalmore Cigar Malt / 44% ABV / Â£7 30ml sample**

*Tasted neat*

My cask broker keeps telling me that Dalmore *sells* and I believe him, but ever since I've tried the core 12/18 range, I've not been a fan of it at all, so I've thrown in this sample in another, more exciting, Master of Malt order.

It is a NAS single malt discontinued in 2009 and replaced by The Cigar Malt *Reserve*.

I am slightly confused by this sample, because it is supposed to be the original Cigar Malt, but that was 40% and this sample bottle is labeled at 44%.

* **Color:** e150a
* **Nose:** sherry, leather sofa, sweat, cherry cough syrup
* **Taste:** oranges, beer jerky, spiced rum, very hot despite it's low ABV
* **Finish:** extremely sweet, long, cloying; vomit

Closest thing for me to this is Grand Marnier, it has nothing about I like in any way.  It's most vile.  I wish I hadn't drank it.

This is the perfect gift for someone you hate and want to never appreciate good whiskey.

**Rating: -50/100**
