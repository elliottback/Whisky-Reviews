**Clynelish 1997 Wemyss 22 Year / 49.8% /  Â£200**

*Tasted neat, then with a bit of bottled water*

A 1997 hogshead of Clynelish yielded 236 bottles of [this 22 year old](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/160525/clynelish-1997-wy),  "Tropical Scented Candle."  The bottle tasting notes read "A gentle and waxy HOGSHEAD with mouth-watering tropical fruit flavours."

* **Color:** amontillado sherry (0.9)
* **Nose:** dragonfruit, kiwi, lemon; dunnage warehouse, candlewax, christmas spice
* **Taste:** waxy oily mouthfeel, lemon cake; sourdough bread and banana cream
* **Finish:** medium, fruit salad, oak, and vanilla

This is a really typical, classic Clynelish, with a lot of fruitiness and waxiness; very clean, it could benefit from a little more age, but also the ABV is quite low for 22 years, so it probably couldn't hold out any longer.

**Rating: 89/100**
