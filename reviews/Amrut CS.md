**Amrut Cask Strength**

*62% ABV, tasted neat, then with a drop of water*

*Special thanks to our boy [texacer](http://www.reddit.com/user/texacer) and the [/r/scotchswap](http://www.reddit.com/r/scotchswap) fellows for the sample!*

* Color: Yellow, slight orange tint
* Nose: alcohol, oily sweetness, malt
* Taste: front-loaded oak, like a Dalmore, round/rolling fireplace smoke, which when diluted with water, opens up to honey and light floral notes
* Finish: warm sweetness, caramel, lush meadow

This is neither a sweet sherry-cask Scotch nor a biting Islay; it's a fireplace dram, made for the winter, someone to hug.  You can pour this and sip your evening away slowly.  While it is a 2007 limited edition, there appears to be good stock online around ~$60, which at this ABV, is an incredible deal (compare to 43% abv, you are paying $42 for the bottle).  Recommend!

**Rating: 90/100**

*Will be buying a bottle if the opportunity presents / contemplating impulse buy*
