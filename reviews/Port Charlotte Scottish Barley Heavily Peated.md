**Bruichladdich Port Charlotte "Scottish Barley" Heavily Peated / 50% / $70**

*Tasted neat*

This is one of the regular releases now from Bruichladdich, a heavily peated (40ppm) Port Charlotte bottled at high strength, using barley from Scotland, and water from the local loch.

Mood: sewing.

* **Color:** swedish blonde
* **Nose:** bananas, peat smoke, toluene, plastic, **pineapple**
* **Taste:** pineapple crumble, big peat, oily campfire smoke, kippers
* **Finish:** savory, creamy barbeque, glazed doughnuts

I like it, but there are a few weird off notes and a sense of a hot spirit that I didn't get with the PCn releases.  The flavour is here, though.

**Rating: 81/100**
