**Caol Ila 2007 Feis Ile 12 Year / 55.8%**

*Tasted neat*

[This](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/96911/caol-ila-12-year-old) Caol Ila was bottled for Feis Ile 2017, part of a 1,500 bottle release for the annual festival.  It's twelve years old, and was double matured in ex-Amoroso casks.  It is also natural cask strength, and was selected by Eddie Thom.

If you're wondering what [Amoroso sherry](https://www.indigowine.com/wine/amoroso/) is, it's also the cask-type used to finish Talisker Distiller's Editions, and is producer *El Maestro Sierra*'s proprietary 15-year Oloroso doped with 4-year aged PX sherry to sweeten it up.

* **Color:** amontillado sherry (0.9)
* **Nose:** sweet peat, asphalt, burnt egg, and cantaloupe
* **Taste:** prickly aloe juice, peat and iodine, smoke, ash, and sweet sherry
* **Finish:** long, peaty, smoothly smokey, with a hint of sweetness

This is interesting, taking a cask strength Caol Ila and putting it into a sweeter cask finish.  I don't quite like it at 12 years, as the sweetness from the sherry fights with the brashness of 12 year old Caol Ila.  I think it would do quite good in the early 20 years of age.

**Rating: 85/100**
