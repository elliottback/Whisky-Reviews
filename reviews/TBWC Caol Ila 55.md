**That Boutique-y Whisky Company Caol Ila - Batch 2 / 55.0%**

*Tasted with a bit of filtered tapwater*

My most recent review, submitted days before I finished throwing everything out of my house and moving to Japan, was [Caol Ila 12](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/2zz6ah/review_caol_ila_12/), so it seemed appropriate to come back with another Caol Ila.  This is bottle 168 of 278, a much smaller batch 1/3 of the size of Batch 1, but clocking in with a higher 55% ABV; younger spirit no doubt.  

Folks familiar with this series will note that it's a 50cl bottle--not full size.  I also noted the cork is a bit dry/loose.  The hand-drawn label is fantastic!

* **Color:** marigold, darker than the "natural color" 19 year old caol ila next to it, I suspect caramel coloring
* **Nose:** rubbing alcohol, iodine, buttered bread, turpentine
* **Taste:** pepper and peat, oily mouthfeel, dry leather, toffee, ice cream, and pineapple
* **Finish:** long, creamy vanilla, butyric acid

Points in favour: cask-strength-ish (hey it's NAS!), it's fiery but rounded off and oaky.  But, I'm finding it a bit hot so I added more water to see if that improved it.  The nose is mostly gone now, the flavour gets oakier and keeps the oiliness with more salt.  Butyric acid in the finish comes more to the foreground, with more vanilla.  This one needs more water than the usual splash/drop, and while it helps, it still tastes hot.

I'm a big fan of Caol Ila, but I'm finding this NAS blend a bit too gimmicky to represent a good value proposition.  It's interesting and challenging, but far from my favourite Caol Ila.  I would not want to drink this every day, or even every day I wanted to drink CS Caol Ila!
