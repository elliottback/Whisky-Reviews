**Bowmore 15 Darkest / 43%**

*Tasted neat*

It's no suprise to regulars of this sub that I **passionately hate Bowmore 10/12**, but have turned softer towards Bowmore in the 18+ range.  Well, I tried this dram in a Tokyo tasting bar, and had to pick up a bottle back stateside to further evaluate it.  This one is finished in Sherry, and is somewhere between the age range I hate and love.

* **Color:** a richer, redder straw-colour
* **Nose:** ocean spray, peat smoke, salty overripe strawberries
* **Taste:** amazingly deep peat, sherry sweetness, fresh oak, pine needles, cardamom
* **Finish:** tobacco, sugary leather, BBQ, 'dat classic Bowmore taste

OK, I've finally found a regular issue Bowmore I like, this is actually quite amazing.  It's not as clean as the Laphroaig Portwood, but it's a delicious blending of the peatier side of our universe with the sweeter, sherried side.

**Rating: 93/100**
