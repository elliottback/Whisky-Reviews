**The Unknown Experience Secret Highland 20 Year Old / 53.5% / 27,500å†† (JPY)**

*Tasted neat*

There isn't much to find online about this bottle, except a [review](https://hideoutclub.jp/post/detail/aa0bLqU8SM) and [product listings](https://www.saketry.com/u-series-secret-highland-single-malt-2nd-release.html), but this is a selection by Mr. Tensho Okamura from Shimokitazawa Cafe & Bar TEN, where they have put together a year 2000 Clynelish 20 year old.  The label art is cribbed from the Voynich Manuscript, and this is the second release from their label, which sold out almost instantly in Japan.

This was distilled in 2000 and bottled in 2020 from a Bourbon Hogshead, yielding 345 bottles at cask strength 53.5%.  Mine is bottle #322.

* **Color:** deep gold (0.8)
* **Nose:** sulphur, burnt plastic, electrical fire, terps; damp, dank earthiness
* **Taste:** meaty, waxy, charcoal grilled banana skins, tropical fruit salad, vanilla
* **Finish:** long and slightly unpleasant; sickly sweet toxins

This is an interest cask, with some fantastic notes that save it from hitting the 40s, but it's also an absolutely busted cask with the worst off-notes I've tasted in years.

**Rating: 57/100**
