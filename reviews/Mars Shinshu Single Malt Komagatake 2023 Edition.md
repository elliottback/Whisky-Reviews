**Mars Shinshu - Single Malt Komagatake 2023 Edition / 50% / Â¥8,800 (~$60 USD)**

*Tasted neat*

Mars Shinshu is located at the foot of Mount Komagatake in the Japanese alps, and they have produced their [2023 Edition Single Malt Komagatake](https://www.hombo.co.jp/product/mars-singlemalt-komagatake-2023-edition/) from post-restart stocks of matured in bourbon barrels, sherry casks, and port casks.  The out-turn is quite large, at 51,642 bottles.  Since they have been producing single malt since their revival in 2011, they should have sufficient blending stock 12 years later to include some reasonably aged malts.

It is non-chill-filtered, and produced and matured entirely in Japan; the back label offers their tasting notes:

> A rich, tea-like aroma and harmonious, full-bodied flavor reminiscent of ripe persimmons.
