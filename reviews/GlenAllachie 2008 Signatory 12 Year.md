**GlenAllachie 2008 Signatory 12 Year / 62.9%**

*Tasted neat, then with bottled water*

[This GlenAllachie](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/177899/glenallachie-2008-sv) was distilled on 06/05/2008, spent twelve years in a first-fill Sherry cask #900366 until it was bottled on 13/01/2021.  An absolutely massive 626 bottles from this single cask!

* **Color:** treacle (2.0)
* **Nose:** chocolate malt, alcohol, pine sap, lemon rind, caramel, and fudge
* **Taste:** raisins, sherry, leather, cola, syrup, and egg-tarts
* **Finish:** very long and delicious, sweet brownies and vanilla

This cola-coloured GlenAllachie is definitely a wet PX cask; it will absolutely appeal to sherry-bomb lovers!  It's somewhat one-dimensional, but these kind of heavily done casks are the core ingredients that Billy Walker loves to use to rejuvenate a reborn distillery's core expressions.

**Rating: 6/10**
