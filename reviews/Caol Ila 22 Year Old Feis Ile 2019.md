**Caol Ila 22 Year Old Feis Ile 2019 / 58.4%**

*Tasted neat*

[This Caol Ila](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/132216/caol-ila-22-year-old) was released for the 2019 Islay Festival *Feis Ile*, and is a limited 3000 bottle run of 22 year old cask-strength Caol Ila matured in "Sherry-treated American Oak Casks".  This is bottle #691.

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** peat smoke, dessert cake, honeysuckle, salt spray, and white pepper
* **Taste:** thick oily peat and tar, sherry sweetness, iodine, and cypress; some butterscotch, pine sap, and vanilla
* **Finish:** long--ice cream and campfire smoke

Despite being on the most profligate Scotch Whisky distillery in operation today, Caol Ila packs a serious, quality punch, whether at 12 years or 22.  The importance of bottling them at cask strength cannot be underappreciated!  The extra age has tamed none of the peat, but we get dessert flavours coming into play, and some very nice woodiness to this dram. 

**Rating: 7/10**
