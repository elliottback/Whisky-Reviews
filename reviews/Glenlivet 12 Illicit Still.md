**Glenlivet 12 Illicit Still / 48%**

*Tasted neat / blind*

The [Glenlivet Illicit Still](https://web.archive.org/web/20210731223710/https://www.theglenlivet.com/en-US/page/illicit-still) is a special 12 year old, non-chill-filtered release that is inspired by the bootlegging origins of Glenlivet.  It attempts to recreate "how our liquid was first crafted in the early 1800s."

* **Color:** 1.2 (chestnut)
* **Nose:** caramel toffee, magnolias, lime and grapefruit; a little motor oil 
* **Taste:** oily rich mouthfeel, graham-cracker smores, cream, a little orange peel, and cinnamon
* **Finish:** long, rich oak and butter cookies

This is a floral, pleasant, but also punchy dram thanks to the +8% boost in ABV and NCF treatment they've given us.  It's dessert-y, tastes refined and well integrated, and has nothing but a certain single-note simplicity that prevents me from scoring it higher.

**Rating: 6/10**
