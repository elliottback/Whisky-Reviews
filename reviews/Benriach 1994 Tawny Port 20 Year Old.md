**Benriach 1994 Tawny Port 20 Year Old / 55.6% ABV**

*Tasted neat*

[This single-cask #1703 Benriach](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/57075/benriach-1994) was aged 20 years from a Tawny Port Hogshead, with some amount of additional Tawny Port Finish.  It was distilled in 1994, and bottled July 2014; this is bottle #76 of 276.

The label notes suggest:

    Gentle red cherries with a crisp citrus kick mellow to toasted red apples and toasted spices.

* **Color:** mahogany (1.6)
* **Nose:** dunnage warehouse, cracked leather, cigar smoke, and stewed fruits
* **Taste:** maraschino cherries, fruits (sliced pear, baked apple), oily strawberries, and pink bubble gum
* **Finish:** long, maple syrup and sweet wine 

This is the second single-cask Benriach I've tried, and it's good--but it's also missing additional complexity that would set me a point higher.

**Rating: 5/10**
