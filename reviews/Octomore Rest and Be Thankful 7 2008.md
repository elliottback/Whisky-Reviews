**Octomore Rest and Be Thankful 7 2008 / 63.9% / $150**

*Tasted neat*

[This](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/69328/octomore-2008-rbtw) **SUPER HEAVILY PEATED** Octomore is non-chill-filtered, and natural colour at cask strength.  It was distilled on 19/03/2008 from Cask No 2008000908 and left to sit in French Oak until it was bottled on 6th May 2015.  It is bottle #124 of 316.

* **Color:** light brown
* **Nose:** vegetal, lemons, iodine and ocean breeze, spring sunlight
* **Taste:** incredibly oily, vanilla creme, sliced tart mikan oranges, hot spa towers; a hint of young phenols
* **Finish:** medium, hints of the citrus fruit, some vanilla

I'm a bit unhappy with the cork, which is coming a bit apart...

I'm very happy with the spirit!  This might only be 7 years old, but it's got the huge peatiness of Octomore coupled with the lushness of a French Oak cask.  I think it's not quite good enough to stand alongside the perfection that is other Octomore OBs, but it's very very close.

**Rating: 87/100**
