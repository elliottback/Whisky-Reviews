**Longmorn 20 "The Exclusive Malts" / 52.8% ABV / $90**

*Tasted with a drop of water*

This was distilled on June 22nd, 1992, aged for 20 years in oak casks at Longmorn distillery, and then bottled for KLWines by Creative Whisky Co Ltd.  Apaprently the label says "oak casks" while the online description says "full term sherry casks", and my tastebuds confirm the latter...

This is also my first Longmorn!  I'm still looking for a whisky distilled on my actual birthday, but this one is very very close...

* **Color:** hazy reddish brown
* **Nose:** fruitcake, alcohol, rum raisins, musky dankness, sherry
* **Taste:** light grass, sharp oakiness, thick and cloying cake
* **Finish:** medium, some oak, sweetness and leather

I've been having good luck with the IB stuff that KLWines has been bringing in, and this Longmorn is no exception, even if its label doesn't quite say it's sherried.

**Rating: 90/100**
