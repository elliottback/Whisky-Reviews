**Heartwood Convict Redemption 1 / 72.5% ABV / Sample**

*Tasted neat, then with bottled mineral water, then with more water*

Thanks /u/UncleTobys for this sample from 2014 which I have hoarded across continents.  This was aged and bottled by the madlads at  Heartwood Australia, distilled at Tasmania distillery:

    The Convict - Convict Redemption (Batch 1)
    Bottle Size: 500ml
    Alcohol Content: 72.5%
    Age: 12 years - Australian Port Cask
    Distilled May 2001 - Bottled Aug 2013

* **Color:** mahogany (1.6)
* **Nose:** stewed figs, tobacco, pipe smoke, plaster, burnt brisket; brown sugar and vanilla
* **Taste:** Ash, burnt bacon, late-harvest port mixed with cigar butts; roast corn on the cob, molasses
* **Finish:** long, toasted rice crackers, port sweetness, and ash

This is a pretty insane 12 year old, rich and thick with layers of flavours.  As far as World whiskey goes, I continue to be impressed with Omar (Nantou) in Taiwan, Paul John & Amrut in India, but Australia is a bit new to me--and so much of the domestic product doesn't make it overseas, so I'm very pleased to have had a chance to try this one!

**Rating: 93/100**
