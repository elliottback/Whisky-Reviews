**Dalmore 12**

*43% ABV, tasted with ice*

* Color: ochre (brownish yellow)
* Nose: floral pasture, leather
* Taste: immature sap, american oak, a little citrus & spice
* Finish: Sweetness, oak, acidity - quickly fades

A generally clean and inoffensive scotch; the palate a bit heavy on wood and oak; perhaps the 30% sherry casks are not doing enough.  It's sweet, but over quickly, and not particularly rich or complex.  The Dalmore 12 is truly the iced tea of scotch.

**Rating: 65/100**

*Will not buy again--even at $34*
