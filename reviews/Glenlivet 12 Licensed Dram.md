**Glenlivet 12 Licensed Dram / 48%**

*Tasted neat / blind*

The [twelve year old Licensed Dram](https://web.archive.org/web/20220819115635/https://www.theglenlivet.com/zh-TW/the-collection/licensed-dram) (apologies for the unusual link but I can't find this page on their US or UK site) is the next up in Glenlivet's "origins" series pays homage to their first legal distilling license. The main highlight from Glenlivet is that this uses two sources of oak barrels; American and European.

Like its predecessor, it is bottled at a higher 48% and non-chill filtered.

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** some smoke, a bit of floral honeysuckle, orange peel, and ethanol
* **Taste:** pound cake, some spice, hints that a citrus may be nearby, and some honey
* **Finish:** medium, a little tannic, some dry sweetness

This is ok, but it's really not interesting at all. There are off-notes on the alcoholic nose, and the palate doesn't have anything refined to pick up on.  If you wanted a 48% version of standard Glenlivet 12, by all means pick this up!

**Rating: 5/10**
