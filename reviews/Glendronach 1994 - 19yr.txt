**Glendronach 1994 / 19 Yrs / 56.8% ABV**

*Tasted with a bit of NYC water*

Oloroso Sherry Butt, distiller January 28th 1994 and bottled November 2013, cask 67 bottle 93.  Not labelled as cask strength, although it appears it is, or NCF/natural coloured, although it also appears it is :]

* **Color:** coagulated blood
* **Nose:** sweet sherry, airy fruit and citrus, crèmed bananas
* **Taste:** spicy leather, desert wind, dry apple cobbler, sandalwood
* **Finish:** amazingly long, mulched earth, tobacco smoke and fruitcake

I don't think I can really recommend this enough, although I don't recall the price I paid for this, it's well worth it.  This bottle was a UK-only distribution, so if you can get your hands on it, it's fantastic.

**Rating: 96/100**
