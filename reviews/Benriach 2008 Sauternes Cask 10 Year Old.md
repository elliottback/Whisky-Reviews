**Benriach 2008 Sauternes Cask 10 Year Old / 59.7% ABV**

*Tasted neat*

[This Benriach](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/113849/benriach-2008) was also distilled on 10/01/2008, but laid to rest for ten years in Sauternes Barrique 5807 before being bottled in 2018 at ten years old.  This is bottle 64 of 296, and the liner notes read:

    Nose - A patisserie of honey-glazed apple flan and baked peach in creme-caramel
    Colour - Dark golden syrup
    Taste - Sweet honeyed peach with coconut cream developing into candy floss and apricot fruit tarts

* **Color:** burnt umber (1.7)
* **Nose:** crème brûlée, vanilla pods, spicy oak, strawberry, and custard
* **Taste:** sweet wine, oak, some tannins, baked pastry, apple pie, and persimmon
* **Finish:** long, honey, a little spice, vanilla

One of the WhiskyBase reviewers refuses to call this "whisky" and thinks it's "fortified wine", but I think it's a perfectly tasty dessert whisky.  When you buy a full maturation Sauternes cask, you should know what you're getting!

This is absolutely lovely, the marriage of wood and spirit is complete and integrated; you still have a feeling of Benriach even though it's dressed up in sugar and spice.  Enjoy this with a cigar/smoke or on a cold winter's day!

**Rating: 7/10**
