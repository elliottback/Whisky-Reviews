**Glen Scotia 2021 Seasonal Release 12 Year Old / 54.7%**

*Tasted neat*

[This ex-Bourbon Glen Scotia](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/190979/glen-scotia-12-year-old) was finished in both first-fill Oloroso hogsheads and heavily charred American oak barrels.  Twelve years old, it's a large run, but bottled at cask strength.  Availability is *still* very good, so you should be able to snap up a bottle.

* **Color:** russet (1.3)
* **Nose:** pine wood, nuts, chlorine, some sherry, red wine;
* **Taste:** waxy, sweet sherry, some coastal salt, lemon & ginger twist
* **Finish:** a sweet, but relatively short, finish leaves some fruit salad

This is not going to blow your mind, but it's a delightful dram with no flaws and a relatively affordable price tag.

**Rating: 6/10**
