**Glenburgie 21 Gordon & MacPhail / 46%**

*Tasted neat*

Gordon & MacPhail have a special relationship with several distilleries, including Speyside's Glenburgie, and they receive new-make casks that they age and release under a "distillery labels" series.  It is an acceptable compromise from owners Chivas Brothers (Pernod Ricard) in my opinion, as we get an essentially original-bottling line without the Owners having to stray from their blended mainstay.

This is a 21 year old single malt scotch whisky from Glenburgie bottled at 46%; it is not stated to be naturally coloured or non-chill filtered, so I assume it's both.

* **Color:** russet (1.3) e150a
* **Nose:** red delicious apple, grass, caramel, unripe strawberry, and star anise
* **Taste:** candied apple, fresh-cut grass, lemon tart, and stewed stone fruit
* **Finish:** medium; sweet icing sugar, baked apple

This is a very good, fruity, Glenburgie, and G&M really know how to handle an OB line from the quality POV.  My only complaint would probably be that it's a bit expensive at going rate around Â£125, but then again, so is everything these days.

**Rating: 6/10**
