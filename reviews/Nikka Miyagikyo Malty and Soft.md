**Nikka Miyagikyo Malty & Soft / 55%**

*Tasted neat, then with a little bottled water*

Nikka's Miyagikyo distillery was founded by Masataka Taketsuru 30 years after Yoichi in 1989, out of a desire to expand the scope of Nikka's blending operations.  Situated at the junction of two rivers, Miyagikyo operates different, larger pot stills than Yoichi, with a longer distillation time from indirect steam heating. Also, Nikka's only 2 Coffey stills for grain distillation were relocated there in 1999. 

[This is the Distillery Exclusive Malty & Soft](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/85450/miyagikyo-malty-soft), bottled at an appreciative 55%, but only a 500ml bottle.

* **Color:** amontillado sherry (0.9)
* **Nose:** coastal sea spray, green apple, burnt rubber; with water, malty, apple, pear, and honeysuckle
* **Taste:** grape juice, tannins, malteasers, butyric acid; seaweed, maple syrup, and bark
* **Finish:** short, some sweetness

On the balance, this is a well-crafted whisky with some pleasant, but relatively boring notes.  It's a shame it's done up as a 55% "special" project because this is really just a CS "standard expression", a vatting that's put together to be utterly bland.

**Rating: 78/100**
