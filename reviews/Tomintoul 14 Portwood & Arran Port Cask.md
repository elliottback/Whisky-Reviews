**Tomintoul 14 Portwood / 40% / Natural Colour**

*Tasted neat*

I had a thing for port-finished scotches and bought a handful; now I am leaving for a new country in a few days, and trying to get a few reviews and thoughts out the door.

* **Color:** very pale
* **Nose:** quite light, some berries, thus living up to the tagline "the gentle dram"
* **Taste:** you can feel the fruitines of the port finish, which is well integrated, but light; strawberries and blackberries, wheatgrass
* **Finish:** vanilla icecream, leather

This is a pleasant, but uninspiring port-finished dram.  Not a lot of the port influence, but enough to taste it.  Generally innocuous.

**Rating: 72/100**
