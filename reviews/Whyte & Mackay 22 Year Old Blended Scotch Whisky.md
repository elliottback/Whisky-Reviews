**Whyte & Mackay 22 Year Old Blended Scotch Whisky / 43% / $100**

*Tasted neat*

I picked up [this 22 year old blend](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/51639/whyte-mackay-22-year-old-wm) on a whim I later regret, after having several excellent ones from Cadenhead's.  The Cadenhead's are lovely, higher proof, and without any kind of sulphur contamination!

But with this Whyte & Mackay, I have a secret trick: seasonal allergies!  With most of my sense of smell gone, this has become drinkable.

* **Color:** e150a
* **Nose:** sulphur, burnt tires, sherry, sweet berry jam, and fired gunpowder
* **Taste:** rubbery, sweet; some ethanol, green bark, and unripe cranberries  
* **Finish:** short

Even with my nose stuffed up, this is rough stuff.  It's not too sulphury (it's a bit), it's just got dryer-gasket-seal rubber everywhere.

**Rating: 35/100**
