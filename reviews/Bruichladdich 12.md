**Bruichladdich 12 v2 / 46% ABV / NCF**

*tasted neat, then with filtered water*

This curious Islay from Bruichladdich is peated to just 3ppm, matured in first/refill bourbon casks, and distilled from optic barley.  Apparently, Bruichladdich ran out of stocks after a year and half, so this will only be found on dusty shelves now--it's been replaced by the 10 yr in 2011.  Guess the folks at Jura didn't run the stills hard enough before they shut down in '94 ;)

* **Color:** sullen amber, no-E150 *(yay)*
* **Nose:** cherries and pear, floral vanilla, a wee bit of smoke with water
* **Taste:** waxy mouthfeel, cream, clover, a sweet oakiness
* **Finish:** toasted malt and honey coats your mouth, you feel sticky long afterwards

This one is all sugar-and-no-spice.  It's like the icecream of scotch, except it tastes better than that sounds.  It has good balance; you won't get overwhelmed by the sweetness/creaminess, but it's walking a tighrope over Mordor (Sauron loves sweets!).  It's enjoyable, but I probably won't buy it again.

**Rating: 78/100**
