**Laphroaig Cairdeas 2022 Warehouse 1 / 52.2%**

*Tasted neat*

Laphroaig's 2022 [Cairdeas Warehouse 1](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/209611/laphroaig-cairdeas) for Feis Ile 2022 and the Friends of Laphroaig online club is exclusively matured in first-fill ex-Maker’s Mark bourbon barrels, and spent its time maturing in their fabled coastline Warehouse #1.  This whisky is not cask-strength, but they've chosen a fairly high-proof 52.2% strength for the batch.  The price, at €71 ex-VAT, is also quite reasonable.

* **Color:** deep gold (0.8)
* **Nose:** briny, salty peat, butter, lemon rind, honeysuckle, and green grape skins
* **Taste:** phenolic band-aids, thick vanilla ice cream, jasmine, petrichor, and raspberry jam
* **Finish:** long and sweet, with lots of vanilla and cane sugar

This is a very clean-style Laphroaig that masks a little bit of the spirit's nature with a dressing up of very sweet ex-Maker's casks.  "A Laphroaig milkshake", if I had to put it in just three words.  Very nice!

**Rating: 7/10**
