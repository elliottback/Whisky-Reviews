> The [Master of Malt Whisky Advent Calendar](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/drinks-by-the-dram/the-whisky-advent-calendar/) is a $250 box with 24x30ml samples of whisky, including a 50 year old scotch!  To facilitate tasting these little sample, and avoid oversharing, I'll be compiling mine in blocks of 5 and posting them here in an abbreviated format!  Please check out days [1 through 5](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/14d9m2/whiskymas_reviews_days_1_to_5/) and [6 - 10](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/14nd69/whiskymas_reviews_days_6_10/).

**Day 11: [Brown Drink Batch 3](http://www.masterofmalt.com/brown-drink/master-of-malt/master-of-malts-brown-drink-batch-3/brown-drink/?srh=1)**
*41.89% ABV*

If Master of Malt was an American company, they'd be able to divide 750 ml into 30 ml batches evenly, but since they unfortunately are based out of the UK, they have run into the problem that 7 mod 3 leaves 10 ml over per bottle.  They've *solved* this problem by **dumping the remaining bits** into these "Brown Batch" bottlings.  I'm horrified!

* **Color:** e150 amber, murky, not particularly brown
* **Nose:** orange, nutmeg, and cinnamon
* **Taste:** overly sweet, cloves, oil of orange, actual tingling
* **Finish:** bitter mint

If this was supposed to be good, it's not.  It has no redeeming quality.  It's literally a worse version of their [speyside liqueur](http://www.masterofmalt.com/liqueurs/master-of-malt-10-year-old-speyside-whisky-liqueur/?srh=1)...

**Rating: 0/100**
