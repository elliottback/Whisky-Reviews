**Laphroaig 15 / 43% / $100**

*Tasted neat*

A quick Islay review of the now discountinued 15 year Laphroaig, which has been replaced by the 18 year old.  Essentially the 10 year old, with five years on it.  Sadly diluted to 43%, but still hopeful!

* **Color:** amber, about the same as the submission screen
* **Nose:** peat smoke, turpentine, salt, lush vanilla and br�l�es
* **Taste:** plastic, aerosolized tape adhesives, orange peel, cedarwood, jolly ranchers
* **Finish:** uncomplicated, tangy, smokey

Tasty, uncomplicated, and rounded-off little laphroaig dram.  The things that drive people nuts about the 10 year are rounded off, but it's not nearly as dull as the 18 year old.

A relic!
