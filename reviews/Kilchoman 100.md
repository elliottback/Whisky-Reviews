**Kilchoman Inaugural 100% Islay / 3YR / 50% ABV**

*tasted neat*

* Color: pale yellow, lemon juice in iced water
* Nose: grapefruit toasted on an open fire, iodine
* Taste: grassy hay, horses grazing in the sunlight, a bit of vanilla, peat
* Finish: a delicious oily finish, spices that fade into oaky sweetness

This 3 year (aged in Buffalo Trace bourbon barrels) is younger than the 5 years coming off Kilchoman contemporaneously, but is uniquely produced using only Optic barley grown on Islay and malted at the distillery.  This is the *first ever* Islay fully produced on-Island in the farm style.  Peat measures 10 to 20ppm.

**Rating: 93/100**

*Would buy again--in fact, I try to keep a bottle of Kilchoman on the shelves at all times.  It's my favourite startup distillery.*
