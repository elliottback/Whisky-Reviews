**Valdespino Palo Cortado Viejo C.P. / 20%**

*Tasted neat*

First, a little explainer on the [mysteries of Palo Cortado](https://www.sherrynotes.com/sherry-wine-types/palo-cortado/); essentially it's a Fino that fails to fully develop its flor, and matures oxidatively.  This one is a 100% Palomino Fino from the Macharnudo Alto vineyard, drawn from specific barrels of Valdespino’s Fino Inocente and Amontillado Tio Diego.

Produced in Spain, with a Denominación de Origen of Jerez Sherry, Palo Cortado is one of my favourite cask finishes in whisky, and so I sought out a bottle of the Sherry to try, as I am not usually a Sherry-drinker.

* **Color:** brown sherry (1.9)
* **Nose:** brown sugar, grapes, leather, guava, pie crust
* **Taste:** fairly dry, some tannins, funky candy, lemon, and ascorbic acid
* **Finish:** long, with some spice, graham crackers, and citrus

I don't know that I yet *like* or appreciate Sherry as a primary product, but I love the funky weirdness in this dry Palo Cortado from Valdespino.

**Rating: 6/10**
