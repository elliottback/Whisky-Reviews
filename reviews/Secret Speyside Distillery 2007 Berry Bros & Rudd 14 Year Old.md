**Secret Speyside Distillery 2007 Berry Bros & Rudd 14 Year Old / 64%**

*Tasted neat, then with a bit of bottled water*

We don't know too much about [Secret Speyside](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/201014/a-secret-speyside-distillery-2007-br) aside from it a single cask sherry butt #13907, distilled in 2007 and bottled in 2021, one of just 304 bottles.  It is cask strength and non-chill-filtered.

The bottle and labels are recently redesigned for BB&R and quite tasteful.  I like the bottom of the bottle is squared off into flat-facets, and the cork is large and solid.  These should store very well for the collectors out there.

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** oloroso sherry, pipe tobacco, blueberries, grape peels; brown sugar
* **Taste:** sherry, vanilla ice cream, sulphur, toffee, lime; bubblegum, black pepper
* **Finish:** medium, and sweet; butter, some hot elements

I was expecting a little bit more, there's a slight off-note and hotness to this that detracts a wee bit from total enjoyment.  However, it's still a reasonable exemplar of what I think is a Craigellachie.

**Rating: 5/10**
