**Benrinnes 2004 SMWS 36.128 / 58.8%**

*Tasted neat and then with a bit of mineral water*

["MOROCCAN AFTERNOON TEA"](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/104317/benrinnes-2004-smws-36128) is a young 12 year first-fill ex-Bourbon barrel Benrinnes from SMWS with a low out-turn of just 132 bottles.

The bottle promises tantalizing "Aromas of freshly brewed mint tea and dark chocolate cake while to taste, pineapple butter cake and marshmallows in a North African spice mix."

Given the low bottle count, I am not sure what they did with the other half of this cask.

* **Color:** deep copper (1.0)
* **Nose:** earl grey tea, jasmine, lime; danish butter cookies
* **Taste:** fresh cream and pineapple; mango, ash, and cake icing
* **Finish:** thick and syrupy, a long aftertaste of honey

With water, the nose doesn't open up much, but the fruitiness of the flavour comes forward more as you are not being blasted by the higher alcohol level.  Quite pleasant!  However, the promised chocolate does not materialize in any way.

**Rating: 86/100**
