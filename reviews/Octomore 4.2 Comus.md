*Tasted with a drop of bottled water*

The Bruichladdich [Octomore 4.2 Comus](http://www.bruichladdich.com/the-whisky/octomore/4-2-comus-167ppm) is peated to 167ppm, in the same range as the other Octomore offerings, but finished in tasty Chateau dï¿½Yquem casks.  Just 5 years old, and aged primarily in bourbon oak, this is one of 18,000 bottles released in 2012 in a stunning white tube.

> COMUS WAS THE SON OF BACHHUS [GOD OF WINE AND REVELLING] AND CIRCE, DAUGHTER OF HELIOS THE SUN GOD AND A SORCERESS WHO WOULD BEGUILE THE INNOCENT INTO DRINKING HER MAGIC POTIONS.

* **Color:** dandelion
* **Nose:** cream, peat, nutty brittle, brined pork bbq, damp rainforest, iodine, alcohol

If you see this on a shelf somewhere--buy it.  It's young and clean Islay dessert.  While there are other Islays out there with a nice sherry influence, or a light port, the Comus is like an Islay cream custard tart.  It's the 100% in your face Octomore peat blast, and sickeningly sweet Eiswein perfectly melded!
