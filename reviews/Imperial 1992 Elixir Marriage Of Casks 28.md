**Imperial 1992 Elixir "Marriage Of Casks" 28 / 40.8% / Â£250**

*Tasted neat*

[This Imperial](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/158095/imperial-28-year-old-eld) is an odd turnout of 5 ex-bourbon barrels, probably distilled in 1992, but some possibly slightly older, as they do not give the distillation years.  One of just 600 bottles, this has been losing ABV for 28 years, and has settled at an anemic 40.8%.

A note to any buyers of this, the cork / stopper is also quite bad.

* **Color:** deep gold (0.8)
* **Nose:** candle wax, yuzu, oak, vanilla, and baker's yeast
* **Taste:** subdued ash, heavy cream, jasmine, and chewing gum
* **Finish:** short and slightly effervescent, mint; medium sweetness

This marriage of casks is need of a divorce if any of the five were at healthier ABVs.  While this feels like Imperial, it also feels like watered-down flat Imperial with none of the usual bang.

**Rating: 84/100**
