**Aberlour Casg Annamh Batch 4 / 48% ABV / Batch #4**

*tasted neat, then with a splash of bottled water*

Gaelic for "Rare Cask", [this 4th batch of Aberlour Casg Annamh](https://www.aberlour.com/en/our-whisky/casg-annamh-scotch-whisky/) is a vatting of non-age-statement Aberlour whisky, non-chill-filtered and served at 48%, and aged in a combination of Oloroso Sherry and American oak.

I am slightly confused why the label reads "Triple Cask Matured" and then only tells us two of the cask types...

* **Color:** chestnut (1.2)
* **Nose:** nail polish, chlorine, unripe lemon, molasses; sawdust and toluene
* **Taste:** bubble gum, butyric acid, bananas, cola, and oak
* **Finish:** brief, milk and candy

I did not enjoy this at all, in fact, I find it terrible.  Water did nothing to improve it, except mute and dilute the flavours of the whisky.  Any of the core range, like the 12-year, or Abunadh, are far superior to this malt.  

It noses incredibly hot, tastes like it's been vomited up by a creature, and does **not** make me want to return for more.  Avoid!

**Rating: 35/100**
