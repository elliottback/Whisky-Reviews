I wrung the cap loose from the bottle, and found inside:

* **Colour**: Sedona mesas
* **Nose**: Sherried honeysuckle, citrus fruit
* **Palate**: Smoke up front, cake, oak, korean BBQ
* **Finish**: Medium coating of sugar dust, spice, and wood smoke

This is far better than HP 18, and more interesting in the flavour dimension than the Signatory 21 CS I have, but ultimately reminds me of  Johnnie Walker Blue--less interesting than its price.  Try the independent bottlings!
