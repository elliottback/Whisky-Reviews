**Review: Talisker 175th Anniversary Edition / 45.8% ABV / $50**

*tasted neat, then with a bit of water*

* Color: caramelized gold, thick honey
* Nose: grapefruit & lemon, syrupy, coastal spray
* Taste: citrus roasted over oily burnt oak explode into pepper (yes!) and silky toffee (hmm!)
* Finish: long and warm with a slight alcoholic bite, with a bit of water, floral & oak notes

This "special edition" is a vatted non-age statement run of a massive 60,000 bottles to celebrate Talisker's 175th Birthday in 2005.  Scotches as old as the '70s are contained, but their proportions are unknown.

The high level of peating is mostly hidden behind its older age profile and fruity notes.  Not an Islay by any means, but a good sit-down dram for fireplace moments.  Not extremely memorable, but pleasant!

**Rating: 84/100**
