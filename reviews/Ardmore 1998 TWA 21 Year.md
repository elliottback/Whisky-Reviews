**Ardmore 1998 TWA 21 Year / 50.9% ABV**

*Tasted neat and with a bit of bottled water*

[This Ardmore is a collaboration](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/177454/ardmore-1998-pst) between The Whisky Agency (TWA) and the Dornoch Castle Whisky Bar, in celebration of their 20th anniversary.  21 years old, we have just 162 bottles of this, back from when the stills of Ardmore were still coal-fired.  

Ardmore is somewhat rare/unusual in IB/OB as it mainly the workhorse and primary component of Beam-Suntory's *Teacher's Highland Cream*.

* **Color:** amontillado sherry (0.9)
* **Nose:** rose garden, sun-baked earth, peat, boston cream doughnuts; cream
* **Taste:** effervescent, minerally angel food cask, mint, fresh herbs, and lime
* **Finish:** beautiful, long sweet mojito, salt, and peat

What an amazing dram, I am sad to see this bottle go.  If this is my introduction to Ardmore, I'm going to be stretching the wallet to try a few more!

**Rating: 93/100**
