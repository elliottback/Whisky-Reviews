I visited Japan for 10 days recently, with my wife and mother-in-law, but of course I managed to bring back a few samples.

**Nikka Yoichi NAS / 180ml / 43%**

*Tasted neat*

My Japanese is nonexistant to determinate which Yoichi this is, but it's doubtless young, say 10 years, as I bought it at a 7-11 type convenience store in Tokyo.  Also, I can't wake up my wife to prognosticate :)

* **Color:** blonde tinged with orange
* **Nose:** seashore mollusks, pine tar, glue, rose petals, ozone
* **Taste:** rubber, lemongrass, blackberry, and campfire smores
* **Finish:** intensely sugary, long enveloping cream; lemons, thyme

Incredibly affordable (this was perhaps $10?  I don't recall), drinkable, subtle, floral, and pleasant.

**Rating: 87/100**

**Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt 17 / 700ml / 43% / $32**

*Tasted neat*

* **Color:** dark amber
* **Nose:** overwhelming alcohol, sherry, blackberries, spices
* **Taste:** leather, burnt butter, a tiny bit of fruit
* **Finish:** insignificant; cedarwood, pine

The spirit is too hot for seventeen years, and I'm sorry.  It's well-crafted but not subtle, the seventeen years of age hiding something that tastes much younger.  For the price, though, it's a steal!

**Rating: 74/100**

**Kavalan Solist / 196ml / 57%**

This is an interesting Taiwanese, non chill-filtered, natural colour whisky aged in Vinho Barrique for a time.
 
*Tasted neat*

* **Color:** ochre
* **Nose:** leather, musky bog, lime crema, static
* **Taste:** amazing, rich, ripe fresh and bursting with fruit.  Raspberries,  milk chocolate, grass
* **Finish:** moderate; a peat heap, fresh leaves, and beef jerky

I don't remember the price, but I think it was around $80 a full-size bottle.  Is it worth one?  I think so, it's a delicious barrel, with hints of age, and the sweet, fruitiness of the wine barrels that it's been stored in.  I think that Kalavan has possible found an amazing use for old wine barrels!

**Rating: 90/100**

**Kavalan Port Cask / 50ml / 40%**

*Tasted neat*

The low ABV is a disappointment, but the price was ~$8, if I recall correctly.

* **Color:** e150
* **Nose:** moldy leaves, caramel, vanilla
* **Taste:** green grass, apples, yeasty C02, and wind
* **Finish:** nothing

The port cask from Kalavan is seriously weak.

**Rating: 57/100**
