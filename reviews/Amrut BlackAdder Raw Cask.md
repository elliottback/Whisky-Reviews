**Amrut Blackadder Raw Cask / 61.2% / $120?**

*Tasted with a bit of filtered tap water*

This is a peated cask finished, natural colour, non-chill-filtered Amrut distilled in Bengaluru and bottled in Feb 2017 (cask BA27-2017).  This is bottle 112 of 162; like most Raw Cask offerings it is not filtered and has a TON of sediment, which is their unique point.

* **Color:** brown, heavy sedimentation
* **Nose:** a little peat smoke and salt, raspberry, humid oakiness
* **Taste:** clean, peaty, and malty; round, super-oily mouthfeel; hints of mikan orange and leather
* **Finish:** long and sweet, seaweed, and fried bacon

This is a super interesting whisky; both the source (Amrut, Bangaluru India) and the bottling (Raw Cask) bring a lot of uniqueness together in a way that enhances the experience of drinking whisky.  The Raw, unfiltered, cask is definitely heavier, oiler, and generally more tasty than other filtered IB expressions.  It's not over-oaked at all.

I will happily buy more Raw Casks in the future--hats off to both Amrut and Blackadder!

**Rating: 92/100**
