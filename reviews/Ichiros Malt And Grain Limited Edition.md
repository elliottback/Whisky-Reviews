**Ichiro's Malt And Grain - World Blended Whisky - Limited Edition / 48% / Â¥11,000 ($75 USD)**

*Tasted neat*

*Ichiro's Malt & Grain World Blended Whisky Limited Edition* is a 48% NAS world and Japanese single malt and grain whisky blend, naturally coloured, and non-chill-filtered.  On the front, we have it described as:

> This whisky is blended by Ichiro Akuto, founder of the Chichibu distillery.
> 
> He travels to find casks to perfect his blend in addition to his Chichibu single malt.
> 
> This is World Blended Whisky.

Let's see how it is!

* **Color:** burnished (1.1)
* **Nose:** green grapes, grain, nail polish, apple juice, and honey
* **Taste:** oily and thick; ripe plums, cedar, mikan honey, and balsamic vinegar 
* **Finish:** medium; uncomplicated sweetness, vanilla

Letting this blend rest at 48% and NCF is a brilliant way to pack way more flavour and richness into the final result.  There is undeniably a heavy grain component but it mostly comes across on the nose and not the palate.

**Rating: 6/10**
