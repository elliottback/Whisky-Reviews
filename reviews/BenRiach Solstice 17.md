**BenRiach Solstice / 17 years / 50% ABV / $99**

*Tasted with a drop of bottled water*

[This beauty from BenRiach](http://www.benriachdistillery.co.uk/Solstice17yo.html) is a seventeen year old speysider made from **heavily peated** malted barley, matured in bourbon casks, and then finished in tawny port pipes.  This is the second edition, the first was a 15 year old.

There is no statement on the bottle, but the box indicates this is both NCF and natural colour!

* **Color:** gold and ruby bracelet
* **Nose:** coffee cake, tawny port (one of my favourite beverages), sea salt, smokey tomatos
* **Taste:** peaty, smokey iodine and campfire, oak, strawberry and peach, more of the port
* **Finish:** smoked ice cream, cigar smoke

This is an incredibly port-forward, complicated dram.  It's a different port finish than Laphroaig used, a honey concoction, going into a Speyside spirit that's been peated.  You might think that such a bizzarre combination would turn out poorly, but not so--this stuff is amazing!

Normally I would be angry that this is only 50% and not the 58% or low 60s that it could be at cask strength, but it's actually perfectly watered to balance flavour and alcohol concentration.

I just purchased three more bottles of this, at $99 it's an incredible steal.

**Rating: 98/100**
