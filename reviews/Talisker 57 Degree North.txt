**Talisker 57^o North / 57% ABV / 70cl**

*Tasted with a nip of bottled water*

Talisker is the first scotch that got me into whisky, the amazing 10 year old, and I am a massive fan of the beautifully sherried and peppered distiller's edition.  So what I'm looking for in a Tallie is quite simple: peat and pepper--will we get it?  This is a NAS release from "specially selected casks", but it's cask strength, which is an added bonus.

57^o north refers to the location of Talisker on the Isle of Skye.  The bottle imprint notes "LAT 57^o 17' .9N, LONG 06^o 21' .5W."

* **Color:** caramel coloring again, too bad
* **Nose:** peat smoke, vanilla, phenols, hellfire
* **Taste:** viscous cake, ice cream, vanilla, light oak
* **Finish:** cloying alcoholic ketoacidosis

Not what you'd typically expect from a Talisker; it lacks the bite of the 10 and 25 year editions, and is overly rounded and generic.  No pepper, which is a big disappointment for me.

**Rating: 69/100**
