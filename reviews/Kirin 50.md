**Kirin 50° "At the Foot of Mt. Fuji" / 50% / $12**

*Tasted with a splash of Tokyo filtered tapwater*

This is [a NAS blend from Kirin](http://www.fujisanroku.jp/), produced around Mt. Fuji, sold widely in Japan but which for some reason is selling for [$120 or more](https://dekanta.com/store/fujisanroku-whisky/) abroad.

**DO NOT PAY $120 OR MORE!!**

Their newer bottle is identical to mine, but has "non-chill filtered" added.  Mine is definitely chill-filtered.  This is ex-bourbon matured mostly grain whisky.

* **Color:** dark caramel
* **Nose:** alcohol, caramel, maybe vanilla?
* **Taste:** hot, woody, stewed blackberry, a hint of spice
* **Finish:** short, sugary

I think this is more of a mixer whisky (which is great for the Japanese market) to make a nice whisky soda (ハイボール) than a sipping whisky.  It's not really good at all, but it *is* only $12 right now, sold by Amazon JP.

That said, it's very hot, young, grain whisky.  To the point where it's much more offensive than other cheap blends.

**Rating: 36/100**
