**Assorted Cask Samples: IV / CS / Free**

*All are tasted starting neat, adding water if necessary, in a blender's glass*

These are samples of some various casks that are/were available for purchase on the secondary market.  I will be taking a look at them from a different perspective than usual, more to understand the wood/distillery character over time, as all of these are quite young.  I have also anonymized the sellers' / cask-specific information as well; all of these are fairly young, and probably in the Â£4-12,000 range.

I will start these in no particular order, and will use a compressed scale from 1-5:

    (1) No good at all; ruinous; unsalvageable 
    (2) Bad, but maybe it just needs more time
    (3) OK; could be fine with a few more years
    (4) Good; nice stuff, you could bottle it now, or give it a bit more time
    (5) Perfect; why is this still in the cask??

**Renegade Rum: Old Bacolet 50%**

I'm not the biggest rum guy, but [Renegade Rum](https://renegaderum.com/) is a new startup in Grenada making rums from Cane Sugar not molasses, I think.  Wow, the nose is very unique, it's got Japanese raw oysters, cane sugar, fermented pickles, and bottled green olive.  On the mouth, it's like a dirty martini with cane sugar; the finish is green olive juice.

I think you can [buy this at TWE if you're interested](https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/p/61568/renegade-rum-old-bacolet-farm).

*Verdict*: **4-**: I am not sure this is for me, because of my inexperience in the category, but it's super interesting.

**Aber Falls: Welsh Whisky 40%**

A new distillery in Wales, [Aber Falls](https://www.aberfallsdistillery.com/) has a few different spirits on offer.  This is a whisky, decent colour in the glass.  Nose is young, sweet with some oak, honey.  Flavour has a sour note I don't like, otherwise it feels like generic "whisky".  Doesn't help that I don't know the specs, and it's not CS.

*Verdict*: **2**: Not excited to try this again.

**Speyside Distillery Tenne / Tawny Port ~60%**

I like Speyside Distillery, and I love a nice Tawny Port.  Nose is oaky, with some grape and fennel.  Taste combines blackcurrant with spice.  The finish is quite pleasant!

*Verdict*: **4**: This is pretty good, I would like to see it with more age.

**Bunnahabhain 10 Year Sherry Butt / ~60%**

Colour and nose are close to new make; flavour is peated, very nice; similar to Lagavulin 12 CS, lots of iodine and peat.  Some rounding off from oak, but very slight.

*Verdict*: **3-**: I can see this being quite good in more active wood, or with a lot more time.  Personally, I'd maybe think about re-casking it?

**Speyside Distillery 8 Year, ex-Bourbon Hogshead / ~60%**

Fairly innocuous on the nose, but a nice oaky, sweet palate.  Lavender and lemon.  This would be great at 18 / 20 years!

*Verdict*: **4-**: solid, well-made whisky that would be excellent in time.

**Anonymous Irish Pot Still / 3 Years / ~60%**

Menacing but buttery nose; chestnuts, rosewater.  Taste garlic, cream, and honey.  Delicious!

*Verdict*: **5-**: this is already excellent, best of the lot so far.

**Mackmyra 10 year / ~50%**

Piney nose, black licorice, campfire smoke and ... persimmons? The flavour is hugely spruce sap, then a rich oaky and honey.  More botanicals in the mouth and finish.

*Verdict*: **3**: I think this needs to get out of the cask before it becomes a digestive, there's actually too much wood influence here.
