**Kavalan Solist Oloroso Cask S090610008A / 57.8%**

*Tasted neat / with a splash of mineral water*

Aside from being able to say that this is bottle 78 of 319, there's not much known about this ex-Oloroso single cask Kavalan.  I think it's almost 10 years old, but the label reveals nothing.

* **Color:** burnt umber (1.7)
* **Nose:** burnt rubber, dry sherry, white pepper, and bitter herbs
* **Taste:** milk, squeezed orange juice, sugar-dipped hawthorn, and cigar smoke
* **Finish:** long, leather with hints of dragonfruit

Despite some off-nose, the whisky doesn't *taste* rubbery and I quite liked it.  It's rich, complex, and perfect for a cold day!

**Rating: 87/100**
