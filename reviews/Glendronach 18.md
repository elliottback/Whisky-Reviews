**Glendronach "Allardice" 18 / 46%**

*Tasted with a bit of bottled mineral water*

Glendronach is getting lots of love recently for turning out quality, although as they become more well-known, their availability has been falling and price going up.

This is their 18 year standard offering, matured entirely in Oloroso sherry.  It is non-chill-filtered and natural colour. 

* **Color:** raw sienna
* **Nose:** sherry, strawberry poptarts, tilled earth, alcohol
* **Taste:** big sherry, fudge, cream, beef jerky, overripe oranges
* **Finish:** clean, medium length leather and fruits brulee

Wow!  This is not a special overproofed sherry monster, it's a standard 18 year old offering.  And it's great.  It most reminds me of ~30 yro Karuizawa, despite probably never having been near a mizunara tree in its life.

**Rating: 91/100**
