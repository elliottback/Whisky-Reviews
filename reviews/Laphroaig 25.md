**Laphroaig 25 / 51% ABV / $450**

*Tasted neat*

An amazing version of the 25 year old at cask strength, there's not a lot of this floating around!  This is also vatted with some second fill sherry for that extra smoothness and colour.

* **Color:** blood and iron
* **Nose:** canned pears, toffee, driftwood smoke, a bit of vanilla
* **Taste:** salty leather, burnt tires, anise and apple, pie
* **Finish:** pleasantly oaky, honey-syrup, candied fruit & sherry leather, amazingly long and warming

I'm amazed at how well the sherry casks force a lovely bouquet through this.  This is the best Laphroaig I've ever had (probably the last, with this price point); the perfect mix of peaty punchy rubber bands and burning tires with sherried fruits in the highland style.  Unlike OOG, this is a bit heavier on the sweet/sherry side, but it's perfectly balanced.  Amazing stuff!!

**Rating: 98/100**
