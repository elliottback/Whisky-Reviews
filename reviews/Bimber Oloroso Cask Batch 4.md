**Bimber Oloroso Cask Batch 4 / 51.2%**

*Tasted neat*

[This bottle](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/179331/bimber-oloroso-cask) from upstart London distillery Bimber is batch 4 of their Oloroso sherry butt finished series.  Clocking in at 975 bottle and 51.2%, it was bottled 22 March 2021.  Before the finish (of an unknown amount of time), it laid in ex-bourbon first-fill casks.

* **Color:** chestnut (1.2)
* **Nose:** strawberry, mint, turpentine, brown sugar, and cinnamon
* **Taste:** icing sugar, pine, cashews, a little salt, pear, and green grass
* **Finish:** medium, very sweet; custard

For it's very young age (close to 3 years), this is another lesson in how surprisingly quaffable a well-distilled malt can be.  Bravo!

**Rating: 87/100**
