**Glenlivet XXV / 43%  ABV / $350**

*Tasted NEAT*

So, time for this 25 year old Glenlivet, aged 20-something years then finished in Oloroso (aka stinky) sherry casks.  Is it worth the $350?  I won't know, because a kind friend lent me a sample :]

* **Color:** delicate gold, sunbeams
* **Nose:** rubbing alcohol, raisins, a bit thin
* **Taste:** cream and dry sherry, not sweet as expected, nutty
* **Finish:** a slight alcoholic burn, oakiness, and oily/honeyed sherry

This is delicious!  Perhaps it's the cusp of where a 43% ABV can age without getting wimpy, but I quite enojoyed my 2oz sample.  While I wouldn't buy it, if there is ever a cask-strength version of an older Glenlivet, I'd love to give it another try.

It's a perfect slow-sippin' scotch for us curmudgeons.

**Rating: 92/100**
