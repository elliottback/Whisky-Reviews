**Port Charlotte 8 Ar Duthchas / 60.5% ABV**

*Tasted with a bit of filtered tap water*

This is the fourth Port Charlotte regular release, a lovely eight year old bottled at cask strength.   Like the previous, NCF, NC, matured in American Oak, and peated to 40 ppm.

* **Color:** golden
* **Nose:** alcohol, peat smoke, leather, pears
* **Taste:** very thick, oily mouthfeel, huge burst of peat, strawberries
* **Finish:** long, angel food cake and smores

This is, I think, the quintessential Port Charlotte bottling, and it's fantastic--a real firecracker!

**Rating: 91/100**
