**Pig's Nose 5y Blended SCotch/ 40% / $30?**

*Tasted neat*

This is a quick review of the blend that's **"as soft and as smooth as a pig's nose"** for all those Johnnie boys out there.  This is a highland blend.

* **Color:** caramel; although colour doesn't rate much in my reviews unless it's exceptional, this one is completely synthetic
* **Nose:** sweaty marshmellows, pine, corn, and cotton candy
* **Taste:** strawberry, earthy oaky leather, hints of lavender; a watery texture
* **Finish:** long, smooth, and inoffensive grain whisky

This is a perfectly inoffensive dram, and quite subtly blended.  It's fantastically cheap, and a great alternative for the typical blend drinker.  The catchphrase guarantees a joke when you bring it by.

**Rating: 75/100**
