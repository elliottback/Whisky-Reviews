**Bunnahabhain 2009 SMWS 10.199 / 59.0%**

*Tasted neat*

With two years finishing time in a first fill ex-Pedro Ximenez (PX) hogshead, this [baby 10 year Bunnahabhain](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/170126/bunnahabhain-2009-smws-10199) gets the name "Norse and Hawaiian mythology", which was interestingly censored for the North American release.

While I wait for dinner dumplings to cool...

* **Color:** old oak (1.8)
* **Nose:** fudge, chocolate, tannic red wine, anise, and sea spray
* **Taste:** chocolate layer cake, jasmine tea, a little vanilla, and oatmeal cookies 
* **Finish:** chocolate-malt-balls, raisins, and fruit punch

The super-wet-cask finish with PX turns this into a PX bomb, and not a terrible one, but it's extremely heavy and overpowering, like filling your mouth with molasses.

**Rating: 83/100**
