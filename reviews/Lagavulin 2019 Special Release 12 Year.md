**Lagavulin 12 Year - Diageo Special Releases 2019 / 56.5%**

*Tasted neat, then with a little water*

The Special Release [2019 Lagavulin 12 year old](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/140080/lagavulin-12-year-old) cask strength is done up in the new labelling style, with a hawk and plants motif in subdued colours.  Under the tagline of "Powerful & Peaty, the King of Islay" we come to know that this is natural cask strength.  I assume also it's non-chill filtered and natural colour, as Diageo lets these batches vary a bit.

This release was matured in refill American oak, and distilled in 2016/17.  The turnout is at 60,762 bottles (huge!), so you can still pick this up around the â‚¬130-150 mark if there's stock in your local market.

* **Color:** amber (0.7)
* **Nose:** iodine, phenolic peat smoke, nail polish, salt & vinegar, marzipan, and lemons
* **Taste:** cracked pepper, cinnamon cookies, lots of peat, some decaying vegetation, and almonds
* **Finish:** long, more peat meets vanilla cream and burnt sugar

A little more dirty than the blissfully pure Lagavulin 12 CS releases from 2005-2015, this is still a knock-out Lagavulin, and probably the best bang for the buck right now in getting a cask-strength Lagavulin from the OB line.

**Rating: 7/10**
