**Signatory Cask Strength Clynelish 1995 25 Year / 57.2% ABV / $450**

*Tasted neat*

[This sherried Clynelish](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/178758/clynelish-1995-sv) was distilled on 21/11/1995 and bottled on 19/02/2021 from refill sherry butt #11240, landing in my lap as bottle 519 of 570.

* **Color:** brown sherry (1.9)
* **Nose:** molasses, crème brûlée, stewed berries, sandalwood, and lemon-mint-honey tea; salt
* **Taste:** creamsicle, fudge, waxy cherries, malty dry sherry; some tobacco
* **Finish:** long, dessert wine and chocolate; lemon zest

Quite an interesting and delicious Clynelish, it strays quite far from the classic waxy/fruity ex-bourbon maturation profile.  Despite the refill cask, this can only be classed as a sophisticated sherry bomb.  Still, I can't put it down!

**Rating: 90/100**
