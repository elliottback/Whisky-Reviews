**Ardbeg Galileo / 49% ABV / $95**

*tasted neat, w/bottled water*

Galileo is a celebration of the "we sent some new make scotch and oak shavings into SPACE!" event, and at just 12 years old ('99 bottled in '12) it's a Sicilian marsala wine-cask aged blend with regular Arbeg .  I hate to disappoint before we even get into the review, but unlike last year's Alligator, the Galileo is more gimmick and less real Ardbeg.

* **Color:** Dirty blonde
* **Nose:** Peat, cabernet grape, caramel sugars, vanilla
* **Taste:** More oak than usual with an Ardbeg, creme brulee, lavender, and a hint of sulphur
* **Finish:** Sticky, w/water burnt plastic and pineapple

Usually when I go to write a review I'm not looking at 4/5 of the bottle left, but in the case of the Galileo I don't find myself drinking it often.  It's an experiment with Marsala casks gone wrong, a weak wine-sauce that they had to top off with regular Ardbeg to make it palatable.  If you find this one sold out, don't worry--it's really not worth the tasting.

**Rating: 78/100**
