*Tasted neat*

[This Clynelish](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/127918/clynelish-1997-kb) was distilled in 1997 and spent 21 years in Hogshead #7102 producing 224 bottles for Kingsbury in the Japanese domestic market. Bottle tasting notes are the following word soup: "rich, spice, smooth, oak, orange, complex, stellar."

* **Color:** chestnut (1.2)
* **Nose:** honeysuckle, earl grey tea, peppermint, maple syrup and petrichor
