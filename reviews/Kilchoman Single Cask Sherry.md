**Kilchoman Single Cask Sherry / 6Yr / 59.4% ABV / $110**

*Tasted with bottled water*

This is a 100% sherry cask matured [K&L exclusive](http://www.klwines.com/detail.asp?sku=1107569) bottling, cask no 371/06, matured from '06 to '12.  NCF and also natural color (woot).  This was made using barley grown and malted at their own distillery, which is a bit odd in the Port Ellen maltings dominated world.

* **Color:** dandelion
* **Nose:** horse sweat, peat smoke, acetone, dry sherry, rotting straw, kelp
* **Taste:** agressive creaminess, szechuan hot oil, phenolic sea salt campfire
* **Finish:** floral mint and honeysuckle, leather, ice cream, candied apple

This is a banger, it just keeps going.  As it opens up, you get more and more subtlety--and it's only six years old!  While I'd love to see a more heavily toasted/sherried cask used, this was absolutely amazing, and major kudos to the buyers at K&L for sourcing this for us.

Also I am days smoke free (shoutout to [r/e_cigs](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/27dp5a/the_daily_vape_pics_thread_20140605/ci02at0)), so I can taste things again.

**Rating: 93/100**
