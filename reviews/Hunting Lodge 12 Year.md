**Hunting Lodge 12-year-old / 40% / ¥2,100**

*Tasted neat*

What do you do if you're French, living near the channel across from England?  Import malt and make [your own blend](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/117338/hunting-lodge-12-year-old)!

There is no information on this 12 year old blend, which also comes in an 8 year and NAS formats, except vague statements on producer Fauconnier's (owned by La Martiniquaise) website:

    The 12-year old Hunting Lodge is the result of a rigorous selection of the best whiskies 
    from different regions in Scotland. Distilled and matured in the traditional method and 
    aged for 12 years in oak casks, this product offers peaty and a slightly smoky aroma.

* **Color:** chestnut (1.2) -- almost certainly caramel coloured
* **Nose:** not much, a little sweetness, spice, vanilla; saltwater breeze
* **Taste:** some warming sherry, cake, orange peel, and a hint of smokiness
* **Finish:** short; syrupy

This is definitely inspired by Cognac, it's a very thickly sweet blend that is well integrated without any off notes.  For the price, which is about half what Johnny Walker Black goes for, you get a tastier age-statement malt.

Bravo.

**Rating: 82/100**
