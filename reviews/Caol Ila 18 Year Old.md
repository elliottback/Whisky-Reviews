**Caol Ila 18 Year Old / 43%**

*Tasted neat*

I realized I haven't reviewed the [Caol Ila 18](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/47393/caol-ila-18-year-old) standard bottling yet, so let's remedy that!  This is (a) Caol Ila (b) 18 years old, and bottled at 43%.  It is most likely chill-filtered and coloured.  On the upside, it does come with a very stately orange label!

This is a recent batch from the last couple of years.

* **Color:** deep copper (1.0)
* **Nose:** briney seaweed, salt, industrial glue, burnt cheese, a little honey
* **Taste:** chalky peat, burnt rubber, a hint of umami barbeque, some fennel
* **Finish:** quite short; tannins, salt, and peat

While quite drinkable, it's not exactly the pleasurable experience of drinking mid-20s IB Caol Ila, which at cask strength, and probably in better than average wood, allow for more diverse flavors to come through.  This is strangely quite a lot like a thinner version of the Lagavulin 16 year old!

**Rating: 4/10**
