**Chivas Regal 18 First Fill Japanese Oak Finish / 48% ABV / $80?**

*Tasted neat*

This is the Chivas blended 18 year old, finished in Mizunara casks.  Bottle code LKGM3006.  I am not expecting much from this, but the display at the airport was impressive.

* **Color:** e150a
* **Nose:** baked bread with salt, pine, some blackcurrant
* **Taste:** a nice medium-thick mouthfeel heavy on vanilla, with berries and Japanese oak
* **Finish:** Buttery toffee and resin; medium length

There's nothing here to hate, this is actually a pretty well executed blend with a unique finish that does come through--a little bit.  I would probably recommend this as a present over Blue Label, just because it's at least trying a bit more.

**Rating: 75/100**
