**Clynelish 2010 Elixir 9 Yr / 58.2% / $90**

*Tasted with a bit of mineral water*

This very young Clynelish was distilled in 2010 and bottled in 2019 from a barrel (cask #700044) of 242 bottles for Elixir Distiller's "The Whisky Trail" series.

* **Color:** pale gold (0.3)
* **Nose:** green grapes, must, elmer's glue, oak; laboratory solvents
* **Taste:** very bright, steel-aged chardonnay, lemon, ash, and grapefruit
* **Finish:** long, sweet

This is a very young Clynelish but it's quite nice despite that; it's certainly got the expected waxiness and mouthfeel, but it's very tropical/citrus fruits and needs quite a bit of watering.

**Rating: 82/100**
