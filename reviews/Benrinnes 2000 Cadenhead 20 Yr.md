**Benrinnes 2000 Cadenhead 20 Year / 54.7%**

*Tasted neat*

[This is a single-cask from Cadenhead](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/169722/benrinnes-2000-ca) that was finished for about a year in an Oloroso Sherry cask, with an outturn of 336 bottles.  Their tasting notes read:

    Nose: rum and raisin ice cream, applewood, gingerbread
    Palate: sultana loaf, nutmeg, danish pastry
    Finish: cocoa, cherry menthol sweets, chocolate marshmellows

* **Color:** treacle (2.0) -- this is the darkest, most cola whiskey I've ever had!
* **Nose:** dunnage warehouse, wet mulch, raisins, mulled wine, and grape
* **Taste:** banana bread, coal tar, sherry, and fennel
* **Finish:** cloying; sweet, cola and molasses

A heavy-handed wet finish makes this a clumsy Benrinnes, unfortunately not a great sherried or complex whisky. 

**Rating: 75/100**
