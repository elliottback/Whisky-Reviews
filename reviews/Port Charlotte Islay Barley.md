**Port Charlotte Islay Barley / 50% ABV**

*Tasted with a bit of filtered tap water*

This is made from Islay local barley peated to 40PPM, non-chill-filtered or coloured.  It's a NAS, but they distilled it in Dec 2008 and released in 2015, so it's not more than 6 years old.

* **Color:** bottle blonde
* **Nose:** machine shop, salty peat, smoked salmon, turpentine
* **Taste:** very light, clean; some creamy peatiness, damp vegetation, vanilla
* **Finish:** short and dry

I am not particularly impressed with this offering; although it's OK it seems to lack the vivacity and mouthfeel you expect from Bruichladdich's Port Charlottes.

**Rating: 71/100**
