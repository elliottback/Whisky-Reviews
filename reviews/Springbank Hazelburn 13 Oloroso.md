**Hazelburn 13 Oloroso / 50.3% / $150**

*Tasted neat*

[This Hazelburn](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/165213/hazelburn-2007) was distilled at Springbank distillery in June 2009, and spent 13 years in "fresh" ex-Oloroso sherry casks before being bottled in September 2020 at a lovely 50.3% strength.  There were 9,900 bottles produced in this batch.

Springbank produces three main kinds of whisky, which I will contrast in a table below:

| |Springbank|Longrow|Hazelburn|
|---|----------|-------|---------|
|Started|1828|1973|1997|
|Drying Method|lightly peated|heavily peated|air dried|
|Distillations|2.5 times|2 times|3 times|
|Production Focus|80%|10%|10%|

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** floral perfume, chopped mint, green tea, and peaches
* **Taste:** hint of peat, cherries, dry sherry, cigar smoke, and poundcake
* **Finish:** gloriously long

This is just a beautiful dram, and the Springbank expression that I think I love most.

**Rating: 90/100**
