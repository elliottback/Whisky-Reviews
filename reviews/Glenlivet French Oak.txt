**Glenlivet 15 Yr French Oak Reserve / 40% ABV / $60**

*Tasted with some filtered tap water*

Quick sample review of the 15 year, matured in New French Limousin Casks (the very same used frequently for Cognac maturation)!

* **Color:** e150a
* **Nose:** creme brulee, new oak, vanilla extract, crunchy pears
* **Taste:**  a ton of oaky vanilla, tannins, lemon rind, and apple
* **Finish:** long, creamy, with a hint of pine tar and unripe fruit

This punches surprisingly above its price range!  It's not super-complicated, but it's quite tasty/relaxing.  There's a big influence from those new french oak casks; I wonder what it would be like if you finished in new french oak, or left it for 20 years in a refill cask.

**Rating: 85/100**
