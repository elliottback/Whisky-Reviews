**Whisky Scoring Bands / Distribution**

Much like [Malt Review](https://malt-review.com/about/scoring-bands/), I feel that the current hundred point system is both capricious and arbitrary, and too much time is spend around the 80/100 level and not enough range is given to the full possibility of expression.

So, future reviews will be marked up on a 10-point scale without wiggle room of a 7+ or an 8-, and the midpoint--previously which seems to hover around 80/100 and crowds the upper range--will be a 5.
Price, if excessively abnormal, will also be a factor in nudging scores higher (cheap and delicious) or lower (expensive and disappointing) to better reflect the subjective experience. When price is taken into consideration, I will explicitly make note of it.

Without further ado, here is a rough guide to the scoring levels I will use in my reviews going forward:]

* 0--Drainpour / Fake Johnny Walker Red
* 1--Would never drink this again, and might consider never drinking this line of products again
* 2--Potential use in pungent cocktails
* 3--Not good, but perhaps redeemable in a highball
* 4--OK; some flaws, but passable whisky
* 5--Good; could be the "standard" 10/12 year in the lineup
* 6--Good+, I would happily buy this over and over again
* 7--Great! I am excited to drink this!
* 8--Superb, a fantastic bottle
* 9--Stellar, almost cannot imagine anything more delicious
* 10--Perfect, I love it and can find no flaws. The bottle will disappear faster than you can imagine itâ€¦
