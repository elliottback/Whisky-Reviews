**The Octave Islay Blended Malt / 17YR / 52.9% / ~¥15000**

*Tasted with a bit of filtered Tokyo tap water*

A blend from Duncan Taylor, this was 17 years in oak (1997 - 2015) before spending 9 months in an [octave cask](http://www.whiskyintelligence.com/2011/09/the-octave-cask-range-from-duncan-taylor-scotch-whisky-scotch-whisky-news/).  It's bottled at a hefty cask strength of 52.9%, and this is bottle 93/97 from cask 989799.

* **Color:** jurassic park amber
* **Nose:** peat, orange peel, cake, marshmellows, turned earth
* **Taste:** oily leather, vanilla cream, strawberries, butter, ocean salt
* **Finish:** burnt sugar, pie-crust, long and warm

For some reason Tokyo is particularly infested with these bottles, and for me they offer the value of the late-20s Caol Ilas at a much more affordable price.  I think this blend is mostly Caol Ila anyway, although according to the DT website it's apparently 90% malt / 10% grain.

**Rating: 94/100**
