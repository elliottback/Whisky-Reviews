**Elements of Islay Peat and Sherry TWE 20th Anniversary / 56.8% /  Â£41.63**

*Tasted neat, then with a bit of bottled water*

Elixir Distillers put out [this special edition](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/146702/peat-sherry-islay-blended-malt-scotch-whisky-eld) for The Whiskey Exchange 20th Anniversary, an unspecified blend of Islay malts matured in an Oloroso sherry butt.  One of 400 50cl bottles, it looks to be cask strength and non-chill filtered.

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** big dry sherry, cigar smoke, leather, stewed fruits, and yeast
* **Taste:** iodine, dirty peat, christmas cake; oily orange peel
* **Finish:** long; vanilla cream and strawberries 

I'm getting young lagavulin from this--with a really nice sherry finish that's deep enough to give it a real dessert kick, but still keep the Islay character. 

**Rating: 89/100**
