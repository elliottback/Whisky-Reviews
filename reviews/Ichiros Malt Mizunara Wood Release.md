**Ichiro's Malt - Pure Malt Whisky - Mizunara Wood Reserve / 46%**

*Tasted neat*

The Mizunara Wood Reserve (MWR) is whisky distilled at Chichibu, aged probably in mostly ex-bourbon casks, then vatted and married in Mizunara Japanese oak.  It is natural colour and non-chill-filtered.  There is no age statement.

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** sliced pear, peppermint, pine needles, stewed blackberries, hibiscus
* **Taste:** cinnamon, coca cola, wood spice, hongshaorou (soy-brown-sugar braised pork), christmas spiced wine and ginger
* **Finish:** brief but vivid

It's basic but a good introduction to Mizunara, with a lot less subtlety than the finishes on, say, the Chivas Mizunara wood finish 12/18 year old blends.  Very much more wood-forward, but not a bottle I would personally keep in stock.  But if I get one in a lottery / set deal, I won't be unhappy to get another one!

**Rating: 5/10**
