**Macallan 25 / 43% ABV / $600**

*Tasted neat*

Matured in sherry casks from Jerez, this pitiful dram is only 43% ABV, but as one of the top-line Macallans is hopefully the treat their marketing leads me to believe.  I'm skeptical, but open.

* **Color:** burnt umber
* **Nose:** sherry, oak, leather; hot alcohol - generally subdued
* **Taste:** cigar smoke, wood, nutmeg, cream, fresh-cut grass
* **Finish:** medium length - smooth, oaky, burnt brown sugar

Honestly, this is nothing more than OK.  My thesis that older whisky does not make better whisky continues to deliver.

The Macallan CS with its brighter tones and edge, or the incredibly rich Aberlours are far better, and a fraction of the price. I've been drinking peatier scotches recently, so my palate is perfectly tuned to appreciate a good sherried whisky, but this isn't one.

**Rating: 81/100**
