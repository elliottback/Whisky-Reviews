**Benrinnes 1997 BlackAdder Raw Cask 20 Year Old / 56.9%**

*Tasted neat*

Today, a nice [ex-bourbon hogshead #964 Benrinnes](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/108098/benrinnes-1997-ba), distilled in 1997 and bottled 2017 to give a lovely 222 bottles at cask strength.  Thanks to BlackAdder, it is perfused with sediment that allegedly maximizes the flavours of the final malt.

* **Color:** deep gold (0.8)
* **Nose:** dunnage warehouse, fruit salad, whipped cream
* **Taste:** creme brulee, vanilla, oaked pineapple, papaya, and (a little) cut grass
* **Finish:** medium, tropical fruits give way to oak, ice cream, and pudding 

This is a fantastic exemplar of just how good Benrinnes can be in ex-bourbon.  It's very similar to the Benrinnes 1995 Cadenhead's small batch 23 year old, but lighter/sharper with more fruit, compared to the Cadenhead's slightly oakier, older expression.

**Rating: 8/10**
