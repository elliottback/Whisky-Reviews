**Samaroli 'S PEATY 22YR / Batch 6 / 45% ABV / $240**

*Tasted with a splash of filtered tap water*

Bottle #250 of 280, this was distilled in 1995 and bottled in 2017.  This was described online as a Speyside blended with Laphroaig and Highland Park.  Purchased in Japan.

The first thing I noticed with this bottle was the very janky metal screwtop, with poorly functioning threads, and a loose fit.  Label has a bit of water/humidity damage too, maybe from the sea-journey over.  It appears to be NCF, not sure about natural colour.

* **Color:** caramel
* **Nose:** Longmorn-like grassy notes, a hint of salt, yeasty wholegrain bread
* **Taste:** oily mouthfeel, peat smoke, cream, hint of pear
* **Finish:** short; vanilla, a whiff of sherry

They've tried to make a summery, light, peaty blend.  It works, I think, but it doesn't have any particularly interesting character.  You might call it smooth?  It's OK but for the price, I probably wouldn't want to buy it again.

**Rating: 72/100**
