**Clynelish 1996 Signatory 21 / 46% ABV / Â£120**

*Tasted neat and with a drop of bottled water*

[This Clynelish](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/113129/clynelish-1996-sv) was distilled 11.12.1996 and bottled 28.02.2018, for 21 years maturing in a refill sherry butt #11377.  This is bottle #360, which is natural color and non-chill-filtered, but sadly not Cask Strength.

This looks like a sister cask to [this Clynelish](Clynelish%201996%20Signatory%2021.md), so I have high hopes for it!

* **Color:** burnished (1.1)
* **Nose:** really soft sherry, windex, grapefruit, caramel, yoghurt and raisins
* **Taste:** candle-wax, strawberries, lactic acid, pine sap, and more citrus waxiness
* **Finish:** long, jam with a little oak

Very oily (thanks non-chill-filtering) and coating in the mouth, sweet with soft sherry, and quite tasty.  I continue to issue a buy recommendation on ~20 years Clynelish!

**Rating: 89/100**
