**Compass Box No Name #1 / 48.9% / ~$120**

*Tasted neat*

I picked [this](https://www.compassboxwhisky.com/whiskies/index.php?id=24#prettyPhoto) up because the bottle looked cool.  15,000 run.  It's apparently made up of:

* 75.5% Ardbeg in re-charred bourbon
* 10.6% Caol Ila in refill bourbon
* 13.4% Clynelish in re-charred hogsheads
* 0.5% Highland malt blend finished in toasted French oak barrels

* **Color:** yellow
* **Nose:** burning tires, wound tincture, sweaty musk; pineapple with charcoal
* **Taste:** hot, young Ardbeg (7yr), a nice oily mouthfeel, 麻辣, peat over sour dates
* **Finish:** long, smoke ending with butyric acid

This is a bit like a frankenstein Islay dram--it definitely delivers as "Compass Box's peatiest dram yet", but it's so terribly hot and unbalanced that you can't really enjoy it.  A clean Ardbeg 10 or Caol Ila 12 is far better.  I actually feel sorry for the poor Clynelish that went into this.

**Rating: 56/100**
