**Aberfeldy 16 (Batch 2918) / 40%**

*Tasted neat*

[This is batch 2918](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/118559/aberfeldy-16-year-old), an OB Aberfeldy aged for 16 years in casks, and then given a Madeira finish.

* **Color:** russet (1.3), almost certainly coloured
* **Nose:** varnish, green grapes, some banana bread, caramel, and marshmallow
* **Taste:** thin, sweet, and grainy; rum raisin and toffee
* **Finish:** very short, burnt sugar

I don't feel much of an improvement over the 12 years here -- perhaps it's sweeter, and a little maltier--but it's really held back by bottling at 40%.  You could get an equivalent experience sucking on a Wether's Original gum-drop slow-aged in your grandfather's coat pocket for the last year.

**Rating: 74/100**
