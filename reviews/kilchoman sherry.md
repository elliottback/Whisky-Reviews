**Kilchoman Sherry Cask / 46% ABV / $75.99**

*tasted neat, w/bottled water*

This five year old scotch from Islay startup Kilchoman is non-chill-filtered (NCF) and naturally coloured.  It is fully aged in Oloroso sherry casks, and is one of 600 bottles allocated to the US (out of 6,000 made).

* **Color:** rusted water
* **Nose:** caramel, peat-soaked sneakers, chewy sherry, swimming-pool chlorine
* **Taste:** stringy alcoholic burn races like farm horses and disappears; some fruit
* **Finish:** marshmellow, hay, quickly nothing

I absolutely loved the Kilchoman bourbon-aged, cask-strength expressions, but I can't recommend the sherry cask in the same way.  It's quite weak, watery, and muddled.  It's not just the low ABV, a problem that could be cured by purchasing the [cask strength sherry cask](http://www.hitimewine.net/KILCHOMAN-SHERRY-CASK-RELEASE.html), but something premature about the scotch itself.  It hasn't had enough time to age--the sherry cuts the Islay spirit, but like grapes waiting to ferment, hasn't had enough time to impart any of Sherry's gifts.  This one should have probably been vatted with some ex-bourbon casks.

**Rating: 72/100**
