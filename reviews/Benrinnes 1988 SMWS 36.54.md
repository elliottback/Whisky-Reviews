**Benrinnes 1988 SMWS 36.54 / 59.2% / Â£150**

*Tasted with a bit of mineral water*

This bottle, [A cheeky treat for afternoon tea](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/28393/benrinnes-1988-smws-3654) is a Benrinnes distilled 05/1988 and bottled at 23 years of age, a single cask refill sherry butt, one of 483 bottles. 

It suffers from a bit of dry cork syndrome, but the cork remained intact and it merely rubbed off a bit.

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** sherry, nutmeg, carrot cake, black licorice, orange peel 
* **Taste:** a bit of oakiness, rich sweet sherry, vanilla, leather, pizza crust
* **Finish:** long, pipe tobacco and honey

Very nice lightly sherried Benrinnes, it accents without overpowering the spirit.

**Rating: 91/100**
