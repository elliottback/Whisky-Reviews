**Nikka From The Barrel / 51.4% ABV**

*Tasted neat & w/bottled water*

500ml cute square bottle is ~$50.  Took it to Rio for a three day trip, finished 90% with my brother while chain smoking on the balcony.

This is a "double matured" blend from the [Nikka Whisky Distilling Company](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikka_Whisky_Distilling), owned by Asahi:

> Matured malt whisky and grain whisky are blended and then re-casked (a process known as "marriage") to create a rich harmony of distinctly different whiskies. "From the Barrel" is bottled directly from re-casked barrels of whisky and features almost the same alcohol percentage.

* **Color:** swampy 
* **Nose:** refreshingly cool botanicals, virgin oak, brown sugar
* **Taste:** grassy lemon, cardamom, bourbon, cherries, cigar smoke
* **Finish:** long and gorgeous warm sweetness

This is pretty good, and the more you drink the more you warm up to it.  Japanese whisky is top notch.

**Rating: 87/100**
