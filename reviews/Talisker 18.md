**Talisker 18 / 45.8% ABV/ $90**

*Tasted with a bit of filtered tap water*

A decade ago, Talisker 10, favoured by James Bond, was my gateway to an appreciation of whisky, and looking at my review folder I have not yet rated the 18 year old expression.  This one is bottled at a higher ABV, but almost certainly chill filtered and coloured.

* **Color:** caramel
* **Nose:** sweet banana bread, salt toffee, some peat; it's a bit subdued
* **Taste:** a nice oily, tingly mouthfeel with more peatiness coming through.  There's some strawberry in the middle, maybe chocolate?
* **Finish:** long and warm, sweaty salt and cream

This is quite a nice, peaceful, and uncomplicated whisky; great Talisker notes but far more muted than the 10 year old.  It's quite lovely, and very relaxing.

**Rating: 85/100**
