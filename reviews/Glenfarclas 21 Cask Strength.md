**Glenfarclas 21 CS (Batch 1) / 53.5% ABV / $200**

*Tasted with a splash of filtered tap water*

This recently shown up in Japan, and it's a cask strength 21 year old sherry bomb from Glencarclas!

* **Color:** auburn
* **Nose:** leather, sherry, rotting leaves, lemon zest
* **Taste:** warm spiced cake, nutmeg, cigar smoke, 
* **Finish:** long and rich, citrusy

This packs quite a lovely punch.  It's a lighter sherried whisky bottled at cask strength, so it's not thick like Abunadh or 105.  I would definitely buy it again.

**Rating: 92/100**
