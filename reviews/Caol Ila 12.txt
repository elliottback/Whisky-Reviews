**Caol Ila 12 / 43%**

*Tasted neat*

Caol Ila is one of the classic Islay malts which is amazing young, and continues to be amazing in the 20-28 year range.  There are countless cask-strength IBs (and even a young CS OB) to enjoy.  This might really be the people's Islay!

* **Color:** sunbeams
* **Nose:** peat smoke, rotting kelp, diesel exhaust, ammonia
* **Taste:** oily, fatty smoke, sweat, cream, honeysuckle
* **Finish:** long, cigar smoke, burning plastic, and vanilla

I consider Caol Ila 12 to be one of my "every other day" drams; for the top of young Islay I place Laphroaig higher, and for something more rounded I tend to like Oogie.  Lagavulin 12, if I'm willing to shell out the cash, blows away Caol Ila at this age range.

That's not to say this is bad--it's quite a nice Islay.  But if you are a Caol Ila fan, the real value tends to be in the older range.

**Rating: 85/100**
