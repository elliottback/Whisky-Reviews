**Glen Grant 1996 SMWS 9.158 "Heavy weight cake" / 59.2% ABV / ￥19,800**

*Tasted neat*

[This Glen Grant](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/123971/glen-grant-1996-smws-9158) is 22 years old, distilled April 23 1996 and aged in ex-bourbon for 20 years, then a first-fill ex-oloroso sherry hogshead for 3 years, one of 239 bottles.  It is also my first review of Glen Grant, a speyside distillery I am not overly familiar with, but apparently (owned by Campari) is the #1 Scotch in Italy.

SMWS notes (it is still available to purchase in [Japan](https://smwsjapan.com/9-158) btw) are:

    From the outset we were entwined in a sticky concoction of dried orange skin, treacle
    and cherries. Spiced cake mix delivered cinnamon, nutmeg and mace with runny honey,
    chocolate fudge and tinned fruit cocktail. The viscous texture of linseed oil guided us
    towards rye whiskey with caramelised parsnips and burnt toffee closely followed by the
    sweet fragrance of fuchsia. The palate continued as it began with chewy and rich fruit
    intermingling with chilli and ginger. Dates, prunes and figs introduced madeira cake and
    milk chocolate whilst the finish stood firmly in charred wood. After spending 20 years in
    an ex-bourbon hogshead this was transferred into a 1st fill oloroso hogshead for the
    remainder of its maturation.

* **Color:** reddish-orange brown
* **Nose:** sandy dry sherry, fruit leather, candied orange peel, Pledge™ furniture polish, and cinnamon
* **Taste:** heavy sherry, cherries/oranges, vanilla sponge cake; a nice oily mouthfeel
* **Finish:** the cherry sticks, some leather; medium length

This reminds me a lot of Swedish-style Spiced Winter Wine (Glögg) in whisky form.  I feel like I've got no idea what Glen Grant is about, because the Oloroso cask used must have been incredibly active!  This is tasty, but not interesting enough for me to buy again.

**Rating: 86/100**
