**Benrinnes 2000 Cadenhead Small Batch 18 Yr / 55.7% / $82**

*Tasted with a bit of mineral water*

Another Cadenshead Small Batch Benrinnes, this one with the following stats:

* Distilled in 2000
* Bottled in 2019
* 4 x Bourbon Barrels
* 618 Bottles

Their label tasting notes:

    Nose: Sweet honey with earthy overtunes.  Orange peel with dunnage warehouse and 
          some creamier coconut notes.
    
    Palate: Thick and chewy - orange and lemon zest.  Praline, some fizzy sherbet and 
            then milk chocolate, toffee and cardamon.
    
    Finish: Faint spice, lemongrass and slightly autumnal.  Some red berries, honeycomb 
            and quite buttery and waxy. 

* **Color:** deep gold (0.85)
* **Nose:** lemon meringue pie, chalk, cut grass, marshmallow
* **Taste:** thick and oily, smoked mackerel, malt, slightly-soured milk, salt 
* **Finish:** long, sandalwood and synthetic orange perfume

This is tolerable. It's quite estery and would have benefited, I think, from another 5 years in the wood.

**Rating: 71/100**
