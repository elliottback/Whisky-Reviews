**Talisker Distiller's Edition / 45.8%  ABV / $75**

*Tasted NEAT, fuck water*

This was distilled in 2001, bottled 2012 with the new "blue stripe" label.  Features a double maturation in Amoroso sherry casks, which I read as perhaps oak then sherry or second-fill sherry than fresh?  I don't know, enlighten me!

* **Color:** deep, incredibly brown, ochre/iron hued
* **Nose:** buttery herbs, seared steak, some vanilla, salt
* **Taste:** a rich, leathery, sweet sherry then ...
* **Finish:** bam, the classic talisker pepper

This is a fantastic Talisker expression--can't recommend it enough.  It tastes less like the sea than regular Talisker, but retains the mouthfeel and pepper.

**Rating: 94/100**
