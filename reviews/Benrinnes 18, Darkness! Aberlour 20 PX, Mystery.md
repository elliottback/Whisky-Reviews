Thanks very much to /u/Scotch_Fanatic for the samples!  I will have to guess on the third, no clue what it is.

**Benrinnes 1995 "Ultimate" / 18 yr / 46% ABV**

*Tasted neat*

This Benrinnes is clearly natural color, possibly chill-filtered from a small IB.  We'll see how it compares to the sherry bombs I've tried so far--if Sherry touched this, very little did, so it's a great opportunity to try the spirit closer to its natural state.

* **Color:** mild tea
* **Nose:** meaty hay, strawberries, lime, hints of oak and coconut
* **Taste:** zesty lemon tingle, orange peel, cake, port-wine
* **Finish:** vanilla ice cream, grass, oily pine

This is an excellent, less bitter/grassy, and pleasantly aged Longmorn.  It's a rounder, with a nicer mouthfeel, fall dram.  I'm not completely blown away, but it's perfect, with no off notes--extremely floral.

**Rating: 89/100**

**Darkness! Aberlour 20 Year Old Pedro Ximï¿½nez / 20 yr / 53.7% ABV**

*Tasted with a nip of water*

This pretentious dram was aged in a PX octave cask for just three months.  The tiny 50 litre casks expose much of the sherry influence, less of the wood, and are first-fill.  [Master of Malt, sadly, bottled these in 50cl bottles](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/aberlour/darkness-aberlour-20-year-old-pedro-ximenez-cask-finish-whisky/).

* **Color:** autumn yellow/brown leaves
* **Nose:** earthy, musty, dank forest; acetone, unprocessed tobacco leaf
* **Taste:** rich, full-grain leather, lean jerky, dry sherry, wildfire
* **Finish:** short, woody, medium-bodied, plums

I quite liked this, it's a bit like the 12 NCF with more depth, more aged leather and cigars, and the sherry shines through because it's so dry!

**Rating: 91/100**

**/u/Scotch_Fanatic mystery dram**

*Tasted neat*

This must be good because he only sent me an ounce ;)

* **Color:** brown
* **Nose:** musky, earthy sherry, aged Mac CS, hints of bacon and bromine 
* **Taste:** buttery, oily, grassy creme cake, tar, rich sherry, barbeque
* **Finish:** long, deep leather, subtle oakiness

Guess: Darkness! Benrinnes PX.

This is quite delicious, and I think my second-favourite of the bunch.  I quite enjoyed the undressed Benrinnes, as it demonstrates the underlying potency and cleanless of the distillate.

**Rating: 92/100**
