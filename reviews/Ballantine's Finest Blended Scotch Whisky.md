**Ballantine's Finest Blended Scotch Whisky / 40%**

*Tasted neat*

This NAS, 40% bottle of blended scotch whisky is [George Ballantine & Son's *Finest*](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/51629/ballantines-finest), and also cheapest blend.  I purchased this to drink over rocks at a hotel from a Don Quijote outside of Tokyo for something in the vicinity of Â¥870 (<$10 USD depending on exchange rates).

* **Color:** chestnut (1.2) -- almost certainly artificially coloured
* **Nose:** inescapable nail polish, lemony citrus, olive brine -- I have an inescapable urge to polish furniture
* **Taste:** I swear I can taste the caramel colouring; some sweetness, sliced apple
* **Finish:** short, hot grain whisky, maybe the tiniest hint of smoke?

If you drink this is a competitor with other highball whiskies, or smash a bottle on the rocks (not literally), you probably will achieve the degree of intoxication you're looking for, but you will have a regrettable and unmemorable drinking session.

**Rating: 3/10**
