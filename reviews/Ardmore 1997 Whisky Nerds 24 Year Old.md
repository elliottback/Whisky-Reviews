**Ardmore 1997 Whisky Nerds 24 Year Old / 49.6% ABV**

*Tasted neat*

[This Ardmore](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/224563/ardmore-1997-wn) from indie bottler *Whiskey Nerds* was distilled at Ardmore on 11/06/1997 and bottled 10/28/2022 from ex-bourbon hogshead #901451.  This is one of just 258 bottles, and *probably* cask strength / NCF?  The label doesn't say.

* **Color:** 1.3 (russet)
* **Nose:** custard-filled glazed doughnut, seaweed, a little peat smoke, fuji apple, bubble gum, and grass
* **Taste:** honey, apple peel, a little oak, strawberries, candlewax, and cut grass
* **Finish:** long, intensely smokey and creamy

A few more years in the cask has rounded this Ardmore out quite a bit, it doesn't have the same punchy intensity that younger bottles have, but it's still undeniably Ardmore.  There is a bit of a lessening, and in the mouth it's a bit of a let-down given the current aftermarket prices and unavailability.

**Rating: 6/10**
