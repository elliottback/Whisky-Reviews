**Benrinnes SMWS 36.134 "Silky, Citrus Purr-suation" / 55.8% ABV / $120?**

*Tasted neat*

I bought [this bottle](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/108662/benrinnes-2002-smws-36134) in Taiwan, a first fill ex-bourbon cask 14 year old, 2002 vintage, because it was a Benrinnes, and I've started to like some of the SMWS bottlings.
