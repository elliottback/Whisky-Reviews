**Glenfarclas 105 / 60% ABV / $75 **

*Tasted neat, w/bottled water*

This is the core cask-strength expression of Glenfarclas, from the Highlands.

* **Color:** a thick reddish-brown ray of sunshine
* **Nose:** overripe fruits bursting with candied spars of pure sherry
* **Taste:** rich leather, tobacco, dry spices (perhaps nutmeg); deep fruits lurk 
* **Finish:** warm and long, the sweetness never loses its rich flavour

This is amazing and often-overlooked sherry bomb.  The '105 is affordable, rich and complex, and a real pleasure to drink.  For smokers, this would pair amazingly well with cigars!  The only thing holding it back is the old fashioned label design, which looks like something out of a countryside '60s cottage ad.

Glenfarclas is still family owned, one of the few remaining private, independent distilleries in Scotland.  About the 105, you can read a few more tasting notes at the [distillery page](http://www.glenfarclas.co.uk/en/pages/78,105-Cask-Strength.html).

**Rating: 93/100**
