**Oban 14 / 43% ABV / NCF (?)**

*tasted neat, w/bottled water*

One of Diageo's "Classic Malts" selection, Oban gets rave reviews, and a high price at the bar, but I've never sat down with it in a controlled setting yet to see if I like it or not.  Coming from one of the smallest distilleries in Scotland (just two pot stills!), I suspect this has been coloured with caramel to maintain consistency among releases.

* **Color:** suprisingly dark and golden
* **Nose:** oil, butter, honey, blueberries, fresh-baked pie
* **Taste:** warming clover and heather, good mouthful, rebounds off the tongue, wood hidden deep behind sunny lavender
* **Finish:** a pinch of smoke, but too short, alas, and an uncomplex sweetness

I get a lot of great floral, grassy, spring meadow out of this malt, but it's incredibly sweet, nearly syropy.  I don't see how it could be had with ice, as they served it up in the bars I've been to.  As a Canadian, I don't have the heart to tell them to bring it back without the ice.  Oban 14 is too delicate, to insubstantial to water down at 43%, or chill on the rocks; it breaks down too much.

Will I buy it if I see it?  Probably not, but it's good enough that I want to get my hands on the Distiller's Edition, finished in Montilla Sherry casks.

**Rating: 78/100**
