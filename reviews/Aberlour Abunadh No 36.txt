**Aberlour A'bunadh / 60.1% ABV / Batch #36**

*tasted neat--you don't drink this one with water!*

A’bunadh, Gaelic for "of the origin," is a NAS scotch from Speyside distiller Aberlour that has been matured in 100% Oloroso ex-sherry butts.  Created to honour the founder of Aberlour distillery James Fleming, A'bunadh is a vatting of 5-25 year old barrels inspired by the legendary find of a 1898 bottle of the original product in 1975.  The contents were analyzed, and in 1997 the first batch landed in our laps!

* **Color:** brown, thick muddied straw
* **Nose:** sherry, rum, almonds, nary a whiff of alcohol
* **Taste:** chocolate, cherries, orange, and raisins
* **Finish:** a butter christmas

This is a big favourite of mine for dramlaxing with a book, or on a rainy night when you need a pick-me-up.  I'm known as a peathead, but sherrybombs are great too, and you can't beat it at $60.  The quality is unmistakable, and batch-to-batch is very consistent.

**Rating: 96/100**
