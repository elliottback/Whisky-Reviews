**Linkwood 2007 *Maltman* 11 Year Old / 52.1% / â‚¬70**

*Tasted neat*

[This 11 Year Linkwood](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/140950/linkwood-2007-mbl) is 302 bottles from ex-bourbon cask #804480, just eleven years old.  It is cask-strength, natural color, and non-chill-filtered.  The back notes read:

    The nose has some praline ice cream, tinned pears and lots of floral notes
    The palate has custard with some walnut and marshmallow.  Give it some time to breathe and it develops with more fruity flavours coming through.
    The finish is warming with some nutmeg and cappuccino.

* **Color:** old gold (0.6)
* **Nose:** musty, nutty lemon cake, pine sap, and turpentine
* **Taste:** smores, lemon-vodka highball, unripe pear, and sliced apple
* **Finish:** long, icing sugar and mint

This is nice, young Linkwood, although I think the cask must have been a little bit busted to drop ABV down to 52.1% after just 11 years.  In my mind, this might have done well with a finish?

**Rating: 84/100**
