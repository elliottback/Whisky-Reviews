**Kilchoman 2013 PX Cask Matured / 6Yr / 47.3% ABV**

*Tasted neat*

[This Kilchoman PX](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/179346/kilchoman-px-sherry-cask-matured) is a vatting of 33 casks, 9 fully matured in PX, and 24 finished in PX between 12 and 18 months.  The bottle notes read:

> _Nose:_ Blackberries, redcurrants and light citrus with layers of golden syrup, dates and rounded smoke
> 
> _Palate:_ Cooked berries, juicy orange and oaky tannins with charred peat smoke and layers of PX sweetness
> 
> _Finish:_ Long and rounded with waves of mixed fruit and lasting sweetness

* **Color:** auburn (1.5)
* **Nose:** classic Kilchoman barnyard peat (subdued), berry cobbler, and leather
* **Taste:** very sweet, spicy oak, sherry, straw, more peat, salt, and christmas cake
* **Finish:** short, more sweetness

This is well made, but I am not a fan of Kilchoman done-up this heavily in PX; the flavours are so dominated by the PX sherry, underneath which you have classic Kilchoman notes, that they don't seem to marry or harmonize, and instead feel a bit confused as to what you are actually drinking.

**Rating: 81/100**
