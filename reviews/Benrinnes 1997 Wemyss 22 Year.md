**Benrinnes 1997 Wemyss 22 Year / 56.9% /  Â£127**

*Tasted neat, then with a bit of bottled water*

Only 147 bottles were produced of [this 22 year old Benrinnes](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/159461/benrinnes-1997-wy), distilled in 1997 and bottled in 2020.

"Sultana Barley Bread" has bottle notes of "A malty and sultana like BARREL reminiscent of Scottish Selkirk Bannock bread."  I am assuming this is probably a refill ex-bourbon barrel.

* **Color:** burnished (1.1)
* **Nose:** alcohol, baked bread, limes; vinegar, poppyseed
* **Taste:** pineapple, toast, lemonade;  rich oakiness and honey
* **Finish:** initial cardboard fades into long, sweet icing 

A bit disappointing on the nose, but this Benrinnes comes through with a tasty, fruity, malt.  There's a bit of sourness to the palate, and a bit of cardboard on the finish that prevents it from being a knock-out.

**Rating: 84/100**
