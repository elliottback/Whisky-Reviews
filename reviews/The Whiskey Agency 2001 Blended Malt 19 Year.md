**The Whiskey Agency 2001 Blended Malt 19 Year / 45.8% / â‚¬100**

*Tasted neat*

[Here](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/174171/blended-malt-2001-twa) we have a nice little TWA mystery blend, relatively low ABV at 45.8% which may not be cask-strength, distilled in 2001 and bottled 2020 for 19 years from a sherry butt, yielding just 389 bottles.

It is natural colour and non-chill-filtered.

* **Color:** brown sherry (1.9)
* **Nose:** coca cola, cough syrup, key-lime pie; pineapple
* **Taste:** craft cola, grilled salmon, milk chocolate; a hint of peat?
* **Finish:** a long sour-smokey feel, bubbly; lemon-rinds

This one's a bit of a muddled mess with maybe a dash of something peated thrown in to "freshen" it up.

**Rating: 80/100**
