**Laphroaig 4 Oak / 40% / ~$50**

*Tasted with a bit of filtered tap water*

This is some kind Laphroaig travel retail gimmick where a blend of bourbon barrels, quarter casks, American oak, and European oak are blended.  My first impressions pulling the cork are that it's not as nice a cork (more plasticy) than Laphroaig QC.

* **Color:** blonde
* **Nose:** watery Laphroaig? a little peat, some vanilla, sugar, strawberries
* **Taste:** smoked pears, sweet cream, caramelized onions, more s'mores than campfire
* **Finish:** short, butter and malingering sweetness

This is a Laphroaig for people that don't like Laphroaig, because it is far sweeter than the 10 or QC or 10CS, and far less punchy on all the Islay characteristics.  I bought it only because the local was out of QC and I hadn't tried it yet--I would not purchase again unless it went < $30.

**Rating: 65/100**
