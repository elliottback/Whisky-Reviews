**North British 1991 Signatory Cask Strength 28 Year / 47.4%**

*Tasted neat*

I have not gotten into Single Grain whiskies yet, but there's value there to be had in longly-aged bottles for prices that are a fraction of a single malt.

[This North British](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/157056/north-british-1991-sv) from Signatory Cask Strength was distilled in 02/09/1991, laid to rest in refill sherry butt 262056 for 28 years, and bottled on 04/03/2020.  This is bottle 45 of just 283.

The yields and ABV on this butt are a bit low; solving 600 litres / 0.7 bottle-liters * x^28 years = 283 bottles, we get 0.961196, or an annual angel's share of 3.9%, which seems higher than average.

* **Color:** burnt umber (1.7)
* **Nose:** strawberry jam, pine needles, ethanol, fennel, soft sherry
* **Taste:** lots of spiced wine, mealy sherry, orange and lemon peel; leather & jerky
* **Finish:** long and sweet, star anise, cracked salt, and vanilla

The folks at Signatory continue to put out really lovely stuff; I'd love to have a rummage through their warehouse some day.

**Rating: 89/100**
