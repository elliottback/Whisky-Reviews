**Blair Athol 2008 SMWS 68.47 11 Year Old / 55.4%**

*Tasted neat*

[This Blair Athol](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/164278/blair-athol-2008-smws-6847), named "Riveting Raspberry Truffles", was distilled on 17.10.2008, spent nine years in an ex-bourbon hogshead,and then the last two in a 1st fill Oloroso hogshead.

SMWS describes it as:

    A lovely deep fruity aroma like that of a raspberry pudding topped with roasted pecans, hazelnuts and warm vanilla sauce. The taste was delicious creamy â€“ a chocolate mouse or a rose, raspberry and coconut fool of crystallized rose petals, double cream and toasted coconut flakes.

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** burnt fruit, almonds, some lemon citrus, toasted cream, salt, and muscat grape  
* **Taste:** smores, fruit tarts, some sweet sherry, dark chocolate and raspberries; maple syrup 
* **Finish:** long, very sweet, with a little bit of graham cracker and some more fruit

SMWS finishes are getting quite good, this is a nice dessert-style dram.

**Rating: 7/10**
