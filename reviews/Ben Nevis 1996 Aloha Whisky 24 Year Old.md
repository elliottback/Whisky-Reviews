Featuring a lovely label in an Ukiyo-e style of Waikiki beach in Honolulu Hawaii, this Ben Nevis was distilled on 08/11/1996, laid into single hogshead #1826, and bottled on 12/01/2021 at 50% ABV.

Just 216 bottles!

* **Color:** old gold (0.6)
* **Nose:** bright cantaloupe, malty banana and pineapple, apples! and a little acetone
* **Taste:** oak, quite dry, tropical fruits, apple turnover pastries, and cream 
* **Finish:** short, but pleasant and floral

Proof again that it's really hard to find a bad Ben Nevis, this is quite lovely.

**Rating: 7/10**
