From the makers of Hibiki and Yamazaki comes a strange peated single malt from the Japanese alps.  10 years ago Hakushu wasn't peated.  Now a delicate waft of smoke drifts across your palate as you imbibe.  And now it's finally coming to the US--I picked my bottle off a shelf in NYC somewhere.  According to [Whisky Advocate](http://www.whiskyadvocateblog.com/2012/05/11/mike-miyamoto-explains-hakushu/), the Hakushu 12 is actually a *triple blend* of unpeated, heavily peated, and sherried casks.

Of all the entry-line Japanese whiskies I've tried--The Yamazaki 12/18, Hibiki 12--**this is by far the best**.  The Hakushu 12 has such a light touch of peat smoke, it's the Monica Bellucci to an Islay Megan Fox.  It's light but with enough complexity to draw you in.  When you pick it up, you get floral fruits and sweetness, and wonder where's the legendary peat?!  But then it hits in a medium length finish, and you are enlightened!

*Would buy again*

**Rating: 91/100**
