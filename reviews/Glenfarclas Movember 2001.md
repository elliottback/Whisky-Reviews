> The [Master of Malt Whisky Advent Calendar](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/drinks-by-the-dram/the-whisky-advent-calendar/) is a $250 box with 24x30ml samples of whisky, including a 50 year old scotch!  To facilitate tasting these little sample, and avoid oversharing, I'll be compiling mine in blocks of 5 and posting them here in an abbreviated format!  Please check out days [1 through 5](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/14d9m2/whiskymas_reviews_days_1_to_5/) and [6 - 10](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/14nd69/whiskymas_reviews_days_6_10/).

**Day 14: [Glenfarclas / Movember 2011](http://www.masterofmalt.com/movember/)**
*53% ABV*

A vatting of two 9 year old Glenfarclas sherry-casks.

* **Color:** tough-mudder brown
* **Nose:** cherries.  ow! alcoholic burn
* **Taste:** firey raisins, sherry candy, brie and apricot
* **Finish:** legs for days, leather and cigar smoke

This is the best sample of this batch, and it's quite excellent.  It's a fiery little beast of a sherry-bomb, and differs from the more mature Glenfarclas 105 Cask-Strength in some interesting ways.  The alcohol is more pronounced, and it's less rich, with a more agressive attack on the palate.  The nose is more subdued.

**Rating: 84/100**
