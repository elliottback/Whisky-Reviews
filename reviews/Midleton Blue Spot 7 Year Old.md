**Midleton Blue Spot 7 Year Old / 58.9% ABV**

*Tasted neat*

The last of the Midleton lineup, [Blue Spot](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/169866/blue-spot-07-year-old) is a 7 year old Irish whisky matured in ex-Bourbon, Sherry and Madeira casks.  It's bottled at cask strength, and non-chill filtered.

* **Color:** russet (1.3)
* **Nose:** salt spray, blacktop, caramel, roasted pear, honeysuckle, and petrichor
* **Taste:** rich sherry, crème brûlée, cedar, baked cheese, some raspberry, and icing sugar
* **Finish:** long, a little banana, vanilla ice cream, a hint of smoke, and molasses

This is punchy, and informative as to what Midleton's house style of distillate is like; rich and fruity.  There's interesting elements at work here to pick out, from different subtle woody notes, to the fresh berries and pears of fruit, to some rich, sweet fortified wine from the cask selection.

This is definitely one of the top Irish whiskies I've had the pleasure of trying to date.
