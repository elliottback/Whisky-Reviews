**BlackAdder Sherry Snake - Batch 1 / 61.9% / $100**

*Tasted neat, then with a little bottled water*

[The BlackAdder Sherry Snake](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/174048/single-malt-scotch-whisky-sherry-snake-ba) is an first-fill sherry single cask (un-named distillery), reference SS01.  It was bottled 2020 (no age statement) at cask strength, with no chill-filtration or added colour.  This is bottle 248 of 358, 60 of which were allocated to the Japan market.

* **Color:** russet (1.3)
* **Nose:** pine needles, ethanol, cornbread, burnt sugar, oak; hairspray, grapes, and toluene
* **Taste:** soft sherry, cream, sulphur (brimstoney), black pepper, lime; more citrus, orange jam, creme brulee, and mint
* **Finish:** long, sweet, with berries; raspberry jam, barbeque, and malt

**I'm not sensitive to sulphur, so I liked this -- buyer beware.**

I'd be willing to get this is Glenfarclas; it's very-much into sherry bomb territory with the punchy 62% ABV and sulphur.

**Rating: 87/100**
