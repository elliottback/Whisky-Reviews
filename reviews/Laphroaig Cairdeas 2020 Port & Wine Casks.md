**Laphroaig Cairdeas 2020 Port & Wine Casks / 52%**

*Tasted neat*

The [Laphroaig Cairdeas 2020](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/176213/laphroaig-cairdeas) is a blend of ex-bourbon and second fill ruby Port barriques that have been married together in red wine casks of unknown provenance.  The fact the distillery highlights a marrying period is exciting, we might get an integrated final result.

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** classic Laphroaig kelpy peat smoke and salt; musty vegetation, some spicy berries, and sawdust and leather
* **Taste:** thick, oily honey and caramelized berries on-top smoked pistachio and graham crackers; some fruity wine notes, apple
* **Finish:** medium; sweetness gives way to lingering iodine and salt

Celebrating friendship, this marriage of ex-bourbon and ex-port casks in ex-wine casks works; the spirit is integrated, still undeniably Laphroaig, but softened and teased into fruitier, semi-dry expressions.  Unlike the 10 year old Sherry finish, I am not tasting this in distinct layers; it's a fully married bottling.

**Rating: 7/10**
