**Oban Distiller's Edition 2005 / 43% / $82**

*Tasted neat*

I picked this up as filler to try for a TWE order where I was targeting the Talisker Special Release 2019, because shipping a single bottle to Japan is not good value for the money.

This is the Oban Distiller's edition, distilled in 2005, bottled in 2019 (code OD 168.FE), apparently finished for 6-18 months in a first-fill Montilla Fino Sherry cask.

* **Color:** tawny
* **Nose:** chocolate, orange peels, wet clay, pu'er tea
* **Taste:** thin, dry oranges, clover honey, bitters
* **Finish:** medium; short, cloying sweetness

This is by no means terrible, but it's bland, and lacks structure.  Would not re-buy.

**Rating: 72/100**
