**Strathmill 1990 25 Signatory Cask Strength / 53.8% / $150?**

*Tasted neat*

Strathmill is a Speyside Diageo workhorse distillery that doesn't get out much.  This bottle is 107 of 242, cask #100194, distilled on 09/03/1990 and bottled 23/02/2016, and matured in a Hogshead.

* **Color:** amber
* **Nose:** buttery chestnuts, grape skins, latex, tanins; varnish
* **Taste:** creamy, but a bit hot; grape drink fizz
* **Finish:** long, oaky and hints of habanero pepper

From previous drinking, this absolutely does not handle a bit of water well and drops 10 points not neat.

It's also very singlemindedly a one-grapey-note whisky.

**Rating: 72/100**
