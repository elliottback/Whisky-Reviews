I want to add a datapoint for those interest in auctioning their stuff.  I'm moving countries and don't want to deal with the hassle of insuring bottles, paying proper import tax, etc, so I sent the most valuable to WhiskyAuction.com, probably the biggest online auction site.

What was in the box?  [These six port ellens](http://i.imgur.com/dyfXy3b.jpg), a Noh Kauizawa 28 yr, and the Lagavulin 21 sherry.

These 9 bottles were acquired ~3 years ago for ~$520/ea, and sent to auction early December.  The auction started sometime in Jan and the hammer closed yesterday.

The average hammer price per bottle (in USD) was $1,233.96.  After commission which ran ~18%, the average price was $1,009.77.  This represents an absolute return of 104% or 38% annualized.  The S&P500 in the last 2.72 years has seen an annualized return of 16.68%.

There were, of course, two outliers:

* **Lagavulin 21**:  This bottle didn't do that well, selling for just $20 more than I paid for it, for a 3.83% profit.
* **Karuizawa**: This one is absolutely insane, selling for 382.73% more than I paid for it 2 years ago, netting $1,493 in profit after fees.

The Port Ellens did well, at a respectable 28% annualized.  Suprisingly, recent releases like the 12^th edition did better than older releases like the 7^th or 8^th.  I paid about $120 not included here to ship the bottles to Germany.  Another downside is the 8% loss in EUR/USD in the last 3 months.

While I am excited to defray my moving expenses, I would really love to operate a good volume auction business and be on the 18% guaranteed side :)  I may also benefit on the tax side from no longer being a state/US resident when I declare the profit next year.

**For those interested in "investing" in scotch, be warned.**  This is only $4,500 of initial capital; scaling up to a "reasonable" investment amount of $50,000 would be a full time job and in many cases, impossible due to lack of stock.  Three years ago, the Port Ellens seemed like great buys; they were.  The Karuizawa was a random purchase which turned out to become quite popular recently.  Investing in scotch is often a popularity contest, and much like the equities market, difficult to time (some would say impossible).   Other factors will collude to make your life difficult, such as storage, bottle fakes, breakage, lost shipments, government actions (see Chinese political gifts), and more.

Sláinte.
