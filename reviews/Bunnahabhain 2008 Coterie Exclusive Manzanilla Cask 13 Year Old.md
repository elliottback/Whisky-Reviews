**Bunnahabhain 2008 Coterie Exclusive Manzanilla Cask 13 Year Old / 49.6% / Â£83**

*Tasted neat*

Distilled some time in 2008 and bottled on 23.05.2022, [this Bunnahabhain](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/217910/bunnahabhain-2008#whisky-note-holder) was matured for 13 years in a first-fill Manzanilla sherry cask.  It is non-chill filtered and natural colour, but probably not cask strength and was released for their online fan club, [The Coterie](https://bunnahabhain.com/pages/welcome-to-the-coterie).

* **Color:** mahogany (1.6)
* **Nose:** coastal sea, dark chocolate, raisins, stewed fruit, spice, a little funk, orange oil
* **Taste:** oily, lots of sherry, tiramisu, Jaffa rum-cake, cashews, sourdough bread 
* **Finish:** long; roasted nuts and molasses

This ticks all the boxes:

- full-term ex-sherry cask maturation 
- an age statement
- bottled at a higher proof
- no adulterants

It seems if you can check those boxes, you get excellent, rich, complex Bunnahabhain. 

**Rating: 7/10**
