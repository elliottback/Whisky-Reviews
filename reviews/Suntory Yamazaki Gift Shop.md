**Suntory Yamazaki Gift Shop / 40% / $40**

*Tasted neat*

This is an interesting bottle, NAS, sold only at the distillery and for some limited period of time at special "W" branded shops in Japan.  I picked it up when I [visited the distillery](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/416rff/yamazaki_distillery_tour_pics_46/) near Kyoto, which was awesome and you should do it if you visit Japan.  They had peated Hakushu and other no-longer-released stuff there for $2-3 a sample.

* **Color:** caramel
* **Nose:** pine, tobacco, vanilla, sherry
* **Taste:** bright, slightly sherried, grass, with an oily mouthfeel
* **Finish:** long, leather and spice, oak, custard

I hate on Japanese whisky because of the massive price runup, but the truth is that  it's also quite excellent.  This is a light, summery whisky that's quite delicious.

**Rating: 84/100**
