**Girvan 1991 The Whisky Barrel "Viking 1" 30 Year Old / 53.6% ABV**

*Tasted neat*

[This Girvan](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/199934/girvan-1991-twb) was laid to rest in first-fill palo cortado hogshead #TWB1022 in 1991 and bottled in September 2021 after 30 years.  Mine is bottle #52 of 162.  The back reads:

> Viking 1 spacecraft launched from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on August 20th 1975. Its lander was the first in history to successfully land on Mars.

> After an eleven month journey the Viking 1 lander separated from its orbiter on July 20th 1976. The lander captured the first ever clear image from the martian surface and its biological instruments searched for life on the red planet.

> Matured in a 1st fill Palo Cortado Hogshead. Distilled 1991. Bottled 2021.

> Sweet sherry antimatter, carona of pineapple and Cripps Pink apples leading to a dark chili chocolate nedbular. Gravitational toasted cereals, honeycomb halo and galactic lemon cake finish with sherbet elements.

* **Color:** muscat (1.3)
* **Nose:** honey, pine -- maybe maple syrup?, molasses, dry leaves and cigar smoke; a little ethanol
* **Taste:** apple pie, a squirt of lemon, sandalwood, prickly waxy funk; sour spice
* **Finish:** medium, some sweetness, funky sherry notes; icing sugar 

I quite like this, it's good proof that single-grain can be excellent given time.
