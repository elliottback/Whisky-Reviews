**Benrinnes 2006 SMWS 36.146 / 59.4%**

*Tasted neat and with a bit of mineral water*

["POMELO SEGMENTS AND PINEAPPLE SLICES"](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/118523/benrinnes-2006-smws-36146) promises to be another young, tropical-fruity Benrinnes.  Also an ex-bourbon first-fill like 36.128, it was left to age 11 years before yielding 185 bottles.

The SMWS liner notes promise "Barrel aged plum brandy was followed by slightly sour pomelo sweetened and spiced in the finish; while diluted, creamy coconut almond butter".

* **Color:** amontillado sherry (0.9)
* **Nose:** white pepper, lemonade; white vinegar
* **Taste:** creamsicle, grapefruits, a little chalky
* **Finish:** short, lobster butter

Amazing how a year younger and a (likely) less-active can lead to a total difference in the end product.  This is okay, but I would not buy it again. 

**Rating: 78/100**
