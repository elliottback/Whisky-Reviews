**Ardbeg Corryvreckan / 57.1%  ABV / $75**

*Tasted w/filtered water*

Corryvreckan is named after the famous charybdis of Islay, the whirlpool to the north of the island.  This dram replaced **Airigh Nam Beist** in the Ardbeg NAS lineup.

* **Color:** light amber
* **Nose:** clover-honey, summer muggy peat, alcohol, fennel
* **Taste:** somewhat phenolic saltiness and strong peat, vanillins and spice
* **Finish:** short, but punchy; there's a floral sugariness

While I am quite happy to drink this, and it's not the disaster that was Galileo, it doesn't have any of the amazing complexity that comes with sherried Uigeadail, but it's much more mellowed out than the fantastically clean 10 year old.

To me, this tastes much like one of those famed 21 year old Islays (60+ in scotch-dog years, eh?) that is a bit beyond its prime.

**Rating: 86/100**
