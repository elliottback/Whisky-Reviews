**Highland Park 18 / 43% ABV / $90**

*tasted neat, then with filtered water*

The Highland Park 18 is aged 45% in sherry casks (compared to 20% for the 12), and lightly peated using heather bushes somewhere around 20 ppm.  They are also one of the few distilleries to malt their own barley.  Highland Park is located a half mile north of Scapa in the Orkney isles, and is Scotland's northernmost distillery!

* **Color:** dehydrated urine, thanks to the E150 caramel color
* **Nose:** floral smoke, *sherry*, marshmallow, w/water moldy sesame crackers
* **Taste:** it's an *oak bomb!*, spice, sweet flowers
* **Finish:** salty dried fruit and honey, oak and smoke

Thor and Magnus Erlendsson smite me, but I am not a big fan of the Highland Park 18; much like the Macallan 18, it's the JWB of their line, expensive, mass-produced, and unbalanced.  Too many of the fine notes and flavours of the younger spirits are aged away, leaving your mouth feeling like you've chewed an oak plank into cardboard.  It's peated too, but subtly and with a floral impulse, which is the saving grace of this expression.  Recommendation?  Try it in a bar, maybe you like it.

**Rating: 78/100**
