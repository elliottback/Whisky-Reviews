**Amrut Peated Cask Strength (Batch 38) / 62.8% ABV / 70cl**

*Tasted neat and with a nip of bottled water*

[This lovely Amrut Peated Indian](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/51511/amrut-peated-indian) is cask strength, and natural colour -- no age is disclosed!  Press releases say this is peated to 23 ppm and aged "at least" 4 years, which in India's climate, is more than enough.

> "There is demand, but we can't service it," says Jagdale, Amrut's Chairman. "We cannot accelerate the maturation process. A good whisky can never be a mass product."

* **Color:** burnished (1.1)
* **Nose:** peat smoke, hand sanitizer, barbeque, lavender oil; furniture polish
* **Taste:** beautifully full oily mouthfeel; some oak, orange peel; beery malt, iodine, and citrus  
* **Finish:** medium, quite peaty; salt

Well done, Amrut, this is an excellent CS peated malt whisky, much more full-bodied than some of the standard Islay malts (Ardbeg 10, Caol Ila, Lagavulin), the closest would be something like Laphroaig Quarter Cask minus the band-aids.

**Rating: 86/100**
