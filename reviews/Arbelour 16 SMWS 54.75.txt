**Aberlour 16 SMWS 54.75 / 59.8% / ~$92**

*Tasted neat*

This is a second-fill hogshead toasted again, distilled on 2 October 2002, and one of 187.  I bought it on auction.

* **Color:** burnt bark
* **Nose:** rich fruity oak and citrus peel
* **Taste:** fruits, almonds, and walnuts with blueberry syrup; vanilla and some lemon zest
* **Finish:** long and sweet, a slight impression of oak and leather

This is a very lovely Aberlour, in a rereused cask, and still a lovely dram.  The pricing also, reflects the quality--a nice drink for a cold evening, but not given quite enough love from the casks as the spirit is worth.

**Rating: 86/100**
