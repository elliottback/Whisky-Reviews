**The Glenrothes 1994 / 43% ABV / $66**

*tasted neat*

Word has it that Glennie's on the run, jacking up the prices of scotch, while their quality plummets.  While the 1985 ($99) is quite nice, it's not quite Aberlour A'bunadh good, and the 1994--an even lighter scotch--might not hold up to the test at all!

Here's a couple notes on this 12 year product. from the distillery page:

> We put this Vintage together with the thought of showing an uplifting expression of The Glenrothes. To whet the appetite and enhance the mood. Best either after a light meal or before dinner.

Well, it's after dindins, so let's have at!

* **Color:** swampy gold, definitely getting some green
* **Nose:** vanilla syrup, oak attack, alcohol, muted plastic
* **Taste:** Spice makes everything nice, butter, almonds & vanilla
* **Finish:** The 40% sherry casks come through leaving a honey, sherry finish; quick but pleasant

Oddly, this bottle tastes better having been open a couple of months than when I first cracked it--it seems the oak has died down to a point where this is drinkable and even enjoyable.  Still, for $70 you can find a better dram!

**Rating: 76/100**
