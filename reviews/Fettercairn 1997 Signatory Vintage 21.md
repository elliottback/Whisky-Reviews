**Fettercairn 1997 Signatory Vintage 21 / 58.0%**

*Tasted neat, then with some bottled water*

[This Fettercairn](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/128901/fettercairn-1997-sv) for the *Cask Strength Collection* imprint of Signatory Vintage was distilled on 10/10/1997 and bottled from Hogsheads #5611 and #5612 on 15/02/2019.  This is bottle 139 of 502, and it is natural colour, non-chill filtered, and cask strength.

* **Color:** deep copper (1.0)
* **Nose:** pineapple, green pear, baked apple pie, spice; sea breeze
* **Taste:** vanilla ice cream, almonds, strawberry, and cinnamon; grass
* **Finish:** medium, salt licorice and confectionary; butter

Like almost every Fettercairn I've had, this is a little bit odd, but also delicious in its own way.  Because the brand has not really become popular, it's quite affordable from IBs like Sigantory, and you can get a well-aged Fettercairn without breaking the pocketbook.

**Rating: 89/100**
