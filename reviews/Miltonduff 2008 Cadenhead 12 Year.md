**Miltonduff 2008 Cadenhead & More Baden 12 Year Old / 54.5%**

*Tasted neat*

[This Miltonduff-Glenlivet](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/171193/miltonduff-2008-ca) was distilled in 2008, recasked into an Oloroso Sherry Hogshead in 2019, and bottled in 2020, yielding 318 bottles.  The tasting notes read:

    Nose: Strawberry swirls, buttered toast, soft marshmallows.
    Palate: Chocolate orange, hints of watercress, pine nuts.
    Finish: Chewy!  Pepperoni slices, coffee cake.

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** alcohol, currant jam, a little dry sherry, butter, and raisins
* **Taste:** warm milk, cardboard, chocolate, orange peel, and malt balls
* **Finish:** long and hot, milk bubble tea

One of the more milky and malty whiskies that I have tried, the oloroso finish really makes it much more palatable.  It's still got a bit of a bite to it, with plenty of off-notes.

**Rating: 78/100**
