**Bunnahabhain 13yr Palo Cortado / 55.5%**

*Tasted neat*

I recently [reviewed a 2008 vintage Bunnahabhain Palo Cortado](https://elliottback.medium.com/review-bunnahabhain-12yr-palo-cortado-db77ca65b78a), and [this bottle](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/119173/bunnahabhain-2005) has very similar characteristics; it was distilled on 16 February 2005 and bottled 26 April 2018, making it 13 years old.  It is bottle #534 of 624, and this distillery exclusive was finished in an ex-Palo-Cortado sherry cask.

* **Color:** chestnut (1.2)
* **Nose:**  rum, dry sherry, raisins, banana bread, hazelnut coffee and cream
* **Taste:** dark chocolate, leather, peppered jerky, pastry crust, almonds, and icing sugar 
* **Finish:** long nutty vanilla, creamy, and a hint of blackberry

This continues to be an amazing, deliciously sweet cask treatment from Bunnahabhain, and I will continue to try to buy as many as I can find!

At time of writing, there are no Palo Cortado casks on offer, but keep an eye on [the Distillery Exclusives page](https://bunnahabhain.com/collections/distillery-exclusives) because Bunnahabhain has recently started offering them online!
