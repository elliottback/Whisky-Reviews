**Caol Ila G&M 1990 29 Yr / 51.7% / $250**

*Tasted neat*

[This](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/139012/caol-ila-1990-gm) is a Caol Ila distilled in 1990 and bottled 12 Jul 2019 for the Taiwan market.  Bottle 19 of 219, under the Connoisseur's Choice label.  It is cask strength, non-Chill filtered, and natural colour, as you would expect with a single cask offering of this age.

* **Color:** deep golden
* **Nose:** oakey, dunnage warehouse, pine and peat, nutmeg, and dragonfruit
* **Taste:** oak, smoke, quite a bit of vanilla, a little pepper and beef jerky
* **Finish:** long, quite peaty, with charcoal and tropical fruits

This is a Caol Ila bottled at its prime, and at cask strength.  Once you get much past 30 years I find they get too oakey, but this is just about perfect.  It tastes old but not stale!

**Rating: 93/100**
