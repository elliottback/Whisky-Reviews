**Highland Park Loki / 15 yr / 48.7% ABV**

*Tasted neat*

The second release in the Valhalla series (Thor first), this is a cask-strength treat.  Apparently, it's been aged in casks (partially) containing previously peated whisky.  It retails for $280 in NYC, but I was fortunate enough to get a sample of this.  Unfortunate, my sample did not come in a mini-viking longship :(

* **Color:** burnished gold
* **Nose:** salt, pears, marshmallow, musk, peat and chlorine
* **Taste:** cedarwood, grass, dalmore-like oak, prickly mouthfeel; lavender
* **Finish:** smoke and cream, but not crème fraîche or crème brûlée, more like the tired whipped leftovers of a bachelorette orgy

This is certainly as good or better than the regular Highland Park lineup, although I'd say it's quite similar to the 15 year old, but with more peatiness.  It seems thicker, as well.  Realize if you buy this, you are paying $180 for the cool wooden stand :)

**Rating: 87/100**
