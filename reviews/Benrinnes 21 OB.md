**Benrinnes 21 / 56.9% / $190**

*Tasted neat / with some bottled mineral water*

[This Benrinnes](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/58215/benrinnes-1992) is bottle #0956 distilled 1992 and bottled 2014, from sherry casks of unknown provenance.  I was a huge fan of the previous special release 23 year old version; how does this stack up?

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** ethanol, green apples, PX sherry, lemon-cake  
* **Taste:** peanuts, yeast and malt, porter beer, cereal grains; tawny port 
* **Finish:** long; glazed strawberries and ash

While this is not the absolute banger that the 23 year old was, the 21 year old is still a fantastic dram--more on the nutty, malty profile, with more subtle sherry.  If you can find a bottle < $200, and you're a Benrinnes fan, you'd love it.

**Rating: 91/100**
