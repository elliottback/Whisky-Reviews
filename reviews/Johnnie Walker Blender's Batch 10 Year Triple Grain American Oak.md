**Johnnie Walker Blender's Batch 10 Year Triple Grain American Oak / 41.3%**

*Tasted neat*

This [10-year-old Blender's Batch](https://www.johnniewalker.com/homepage/our-whisky/limited-editions/blenders-batch-triple-grain-american-oak/) is "A blend of 3 Grain Whiskies- Wheat, Barley, and Corn- and 2 Malts - from Cardhu and Mortlach. Aged for 10 years in American Oak Casks."  There's also some Port Dundas in there.

That's more disclosure than we usually get, and they gave up +1.3% on the ABV.

* **Color:** chestnut (1.2) -- artificially coloured again
* **Nose:** rye whiskey, spicy chili peppers, corn, and leather
* **Taste:** butterscotch and marshmallow, togarashi spice, a little oak, and quaker oats
* **Finish:** long but thin, with grainy hot spirit, some hints of sweetness, and licorice

This is pretty good!  It's simultaneously interesting and flat.  In this case, the ABV is not so much the problem I think, as the very grain-forward presentation.

**Rating: 4/10**
