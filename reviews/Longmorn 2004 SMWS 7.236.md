**Longmorn 2004 SMWS 7.236 15 Year / "A sticky Tumble In Apple Crumble" / 59.6%**

*Tasted neat & with a bit of mineral water*

[This 15 Year Old Longmorn](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/157645/longmorn-2004-smws-7236) is another of victim of the Society's craze for finishing all their recent out-turns, having spent 13 years in an ex-bourbon barrel before this was transferred to a 1st fill ex-sauternes barrique for another 2 years.

* **Color:** chestnut (1.2)
* **Nose:** honey, grass lawn, clover, pineapple; nail polish and mint
* **Taste:** ice cream cake, lilies, graham crackers   
* **Finish:** ex-Sauternes cask, so it's vanilla and cloying sweetness; long

This is best without water; it's floral and fragrant, and the dessert finish makes it absolutely deliciously rich and sweet.

**Rating: 90/100**
