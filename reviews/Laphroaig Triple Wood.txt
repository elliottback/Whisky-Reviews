**Laphroaig Triple Wood**

*48% ABV, tasted with a bit of distilled water*

* Color: saturated gold
* Nose: peat, astringent, honey/syrup, almonds
* Taste: peat smoke bite, sweet port, campfire, salt spray, surgery, fruit
* Finish: Oaky @ diluted, peaty @ full strength

What makes this Laphroaig special is that it goes through a triple-maturation process, first in American ex-bourbon oak, second in 19th century style Quarter Casks, and finally in large European oak Oloroso sherry casks to round out the spirit.  This makes it less smokey/peaty than the familiar Laphroaig 10 Cask Strength, with a drinkable sweetness and full bodied flavour that won't turn off more inexperienced drinkers.  While not a pure Laphroaig classic, it's a special single malt that you should try at least once when you still want an Islay, but are tired of getting blown away with the smoke.

Positives:

* Balances smoke and sweetness
* Incredibly drinkable

Negatives:

* ABV too low; straddles regular, CS expressions
* Lacks the traditional Laphroaig "medicinal" taste

**Rating: 93/100**

*Would buy again, after a few CS bottlings*
