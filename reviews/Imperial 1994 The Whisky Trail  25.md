* **Color:** amber
* **Nose:** sliced apples, cornbread, damp earthy forest
* **Taste:** prickly with a thin mouthfeel; fresh asian pear, oaky whipped butter, some vanilla
* **Finish:** unsatisfyingly short, sweetness and pears

This bottling of Imperial has just the slightest hint of the trademark rich, creamy butteriness that people loved the lost distillery for.  Overall, disappointing, and a tired cask.

**Rating: 72/100**
