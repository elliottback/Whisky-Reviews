**Kilchoman Sanaig / 46% / $60**

*Tasted with a bit of filtered Tokyo tap water*

This is a new NAS lineup from Kilchoman to stock alongside their Machir Bay release.  The main highlight is that there is a mixed bourbon/Oloroso sherry maturation.

* **Color:** kidney failure
* **Nose:** peat, vanilla, sherry
* **Taste:** chocolate, lime pie, iodine, smoked kippers
* **Finish:** long caramel, sweet BBQ

Well put-together, nice sherry influence ontop of the bourbon giving it a bit more sweetness, and I appreciate the extra ABV.  Personally, I don't find this to be a standout, but it's good.

**Rating: 80/100**
