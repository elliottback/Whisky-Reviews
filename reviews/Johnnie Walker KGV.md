**Johnnie Walker King George V**

*43% ABV, tasted neat with a drop of water*

* Color: Amber, thick honey with orange
* Nose: sherried figs, syrup, alcohol, vanilla
* Taste: Butter with overwhelming oak wood, a touch of smoke, and light fruit.  The grain whisky used in the blend is noticeable.
* Finish: sweet wood smoke

The "King George V" blend is inferior to the 15 yr pure malt "Green" blend, but comes in a goergeous crystal decanter with stand and a gigantic blue box.  Available on sale for $351, this is not a value whisky, but might make less experienced drinkers happy if bought as a present.  It's smooth and drinkable, but little stands out in its palate.

**Rating: 75/100**
