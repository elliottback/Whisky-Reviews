**Benriach 22 'Albariza' Peated Second Edition / 46% ABV/ $220**

*Tasted with a drop of filtered tap water*

This is a Pedro-Ximenez (PX) sherry cask finished Benriach that is peated, non-chill-filtered, and natural color. It goes by the name 'Albariza', and was matured in American Oak.  Part of their "wood finishes" line.

* **Color:** musty brownish
* **Nose:** very sweet, confectionery shop, some lemon zest, ocean spray
* **Taste:** plummy and salty over the sherry, chocolate and some orange
* **Finish:** long, icing sugar and tobacco smoke, leathery

This is a solid sherried dram that's perhaps unique in how light it is--it's not dragged deep down into sherry bomb syrup, and the bit of peat that it's got helps keep it light.

It's a bit expensive, I do not think I would buy it regularly.

**Rating: 85/100**
