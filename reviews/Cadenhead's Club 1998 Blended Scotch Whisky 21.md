**Cadenhead's Club 1998 Blended Scotch Whisky 21 / 44.7% / Â£87**

*Tasted neat*

This Cadenhead's Club "Warehouse Tasting" bottle is a blended scotch whisky, distilled in 1998, and matured in a Sherry Butt.  Not much else is disclosed on the spartan label, but it has good colour and an affordable price.

* **Color:** russet (1.3)
* **Nose:** cognac, sherry, bread, nutmeg, and sliced pears
* **Taste:** bright sherry, maple syrup, baked apples, and vanilla
* **Finish:** medium, cracked leather, beef jerky, and cream

This is quite a lovely age-statement blend, Cadenhead is really able to put out some nicely affordable blends; I look forward to trying more of them in the future.

**Rating: 88/100**
