I haven't seen 12 year Caol Ila bottled for the Signatory CS line before, but I've recently fallen in love.  These are nice vattings of Caol Ila that exceed the standard 12Yr (being cask strength, at least), with a really well rounded, fruity character.

I've enjoyed their older revisions in the past, but these younger bottles are fantastic value!

**Rating: 90/100**
