**Ardmore 1999 Archives 19 Year Old / 55.8% ABV**

*Tasted neat*

Moving onto the older category, [this 19 year old Ardmore](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/131895/ardmore-1999-arc) from Whiskybase's The Archives: Fishes of Samoa imprint was distilling on 29.09.1999 and laid to rest in ex-bourbon barrel #801661 for 19 years until it was bottled on 07.03.2019.  This series is cask-strength, non-coloured, and non-chill-filtered. 

Going purely off the ABV, this is likely a less-active barrel which should balance showing off Ardmore distillate with a nice, but unoverpowering, feeling of stately age.

* **Color:** burnished (1.1)
* **Nose:** peat smoke, camphor, salt spray, honeysuckle, vanilla, and lemon slices
* **Taste:** oaky, rich toasted sugar with crushed almonds, peat smoke, some iodine, and lemon peel
* **Finish:** medium; oily tropical fruits

The balance here is **perfect**, this is undoubtedly still Ardmore, but it's pleasantly aged, sweet, and oaky.

**Rating: 8/10**
