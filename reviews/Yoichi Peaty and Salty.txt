**Yoichi Peaty & Salty / 55% ABV / $150**

*Tasted with a splash of mineral water*

This is allegedly a distillery exclusive in Hokkaido, but they seem to make the truck down to a few liquor stores in Tokyo on a regular basis.  While marked up a bit from the distillery price, they're still a lot cheaper in Japan than sites like [Dekanta](https://dekanta.com/store/nikka-yoichi-peaty-salty/) that seem to sell it for ~2x.

This is a bit of a step down from previous age-statement peated Yoichi, but still a fine offering at cask strength.  I do believe it's chill-filtered, and probably coloured.

* **Color:** caramel
* **Nose:** salty kelp, roasted apples, peat, damp underbrush, and varnish
* **Taste:** very smokey, with a thick sweet mouthfeel; citrus fruits/lemon zest, cut grass, and a bit of ginger tang
* **Finish:** oily, long, and rich but still quite peaty

Yoichi has to be one of my favourite distilleries in Japan; they're putting out fantastic whisky.  I'd compare this to a peated Longmorn, if I had to pick a scotch.  It's absolutely unique and worth trying should you stumble across it in a bar somewhere!

**Rating: 94/100**
