**Imperial 20 1995 Signatory Vintage / 46% / $110**

*Tasted neat*

This lovely dram was distilled on 18.09.1995 and bottled 18.02.2016 after sitting in Hogsheads numbers 50255, 50257, and 50258.  This is bottle #319 out of some unknown quantity, and is natural colour and unfiltered.  But ... sadly not cask strength!

* **Color:** straw
* **Nose:** creamy and floral, with hints of lemon peel, chalky dry white wine, apricot
* **Taste:** malty and oily, loads of oak and vanilla ice cream; grassy butter
* **Finish:** medium, burnt sugar, crisp green apples

This has that nice, rich, buttery Imperial classic flavour that I like to see.  It would be better at cask strength, but thanks to no chill-filtration, it's quite a nice dram for reading.

**Rating: 85/100**
