**Miltonduff 2007 Gordon & Macphail 10 Year Old / 61.6%**

*Tasted with a bit of bottled water*

[This is a very young Miltonduff](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/109974/miltonduff-2007-gm) done up in refill sherry hogshead #900816, giving 300 bottles at cask strength.  The back notes think it's going to be a sherry bomb, we'll see.

* **Color:** old oak (1.8)
* **Nose:** burnt leather, sulphur, cabernet wine, christmas spice
* **Taste:** dried fruit, bitter chocolate, malty milk, and cereal grains  
* **Finish:** short; a bit of sherriness and cake icing

I'm not a fan of this one; it's spent not enough time in a super-wet cask and so you've got yourself a nice sherry-flavoured very young Miltonduff.

**Rating: 65/100**
