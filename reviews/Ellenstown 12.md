**Ellenstown 12 / 52% ABV / NCF Single Cask**

*tasted neat, then with bottled water*

Nobody actual knows where this independent single cask is from, but rumour has it that it's an **Ardbeg**.  This is the latest edition; previously, there were higher ABV 10 year editions.  Is it a Caol Ila in disguise?  Or an off-cask?  We'll soon find out... 

* **Color:** clear like homeopathic sunshine or turpentine.  You can see the unfiltered particulates.
* **Nose:** malty bread, iodine and peat, w/water some chlorine
* **Taste:** pineapple, brine, and phenol w/water more oak and acid
* **Finish:** leather, salt, and peaches

This is an interesting single malt, at $50, but not one you'd probably ever buy again.  It's tolerable for peatheads, but tastes a bit like a vatting gone wrong between an immature Bowmore and a cask of Caol Ila, with a little bit of some bizzarre Hawaiian Dogfish-Head inspired tropical flavouring thrown in to pollute the distillate.  You may never hear me say this ever again, but it's possible that Chill-Filtration would *improve* the palate of this whisky.  It's a dirty hangover bomb!

**Rating: 72/100**
