**Glenfarclas 25 Cask Strength (Batch 1) / 52.2% ABV / Â¥37,800**

*Tasted neat*

[This bottle](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/228451/glenfarclas-25-year-old) is really batch 4 of the (discontinued) CS 21-year-old series for exclusive Japan release, but with the rebranding to blue-and-gold labels, they have dropped the 21 Year and replaced it with a more expensive 25 Year Old.

* **Color:** auburn (1.5)
* **Nose:** bright sherry, cigar smoke, leather, icing sugar, and honeysuckle
* **Taste:** sherry, tobacco, spice, rich oily oakiness, vanilla ice cream, and cantaloupe
* **Finish:** rich and long, with meaty barbecue fading into citrus zest

I think the extra four years did something here, this is a bit better than the 21 Year CS, but the price increase (nearly double) means that I will probably not be a regular purchaser.

This seems to be produced in more limited quantities; if you live in Japan, [Mukawa still has one bottle](https://mukawa-spirit.com/?pid=171805886).

**Rating: 8/10**
