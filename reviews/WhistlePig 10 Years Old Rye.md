**WhistlePig Aged 10 Years Small Batch Rye / Batch A/365 / 50% / Â¥7,500 (about $50 USD)**

*Tasted neat*

There are a few interesting things about this [WhistlePig Rye Whisky](https://www.whistlepigwhiskey.com/whiskeys/10-year), so I'll list them as bullets:

* It's a blend of straight Rye whiskies
* It is certified Kosher
* It's produced by Alberta Distillers Ltd, so it's Canadian Rye whiskey
* Aged for 10 years, first in virgin American Oak barrels in Canada, and then vatted and finished in Vermont
* The mashbill is not listed, but probably 100% unmalted rye?

Alberta Distillers Limited is owned by Beam Suntory, which means these are cheap, available, and with original labels in Japanese for the Japan market.

* **Color:** russet (1.3)
* **Nose:** apples, candy caramel corn, rye bread, pine sap, lemon, and a little chlorine
* **Taste:** christmas spice, star anise, mango fruits, and oak
* **Finish:** long, honey and green apple, vanilla, and graham cracker smores

This is one of the tastier Ryes that have crossed my desk, it's absolutely a delicious mashup of spicy and fruity rye, and it's married well and aged long enough to impart some nice quality.

I will be keeping my eyes out for any cask-strength/barrel picks if they make it over here!

**Rating: 7/10**
