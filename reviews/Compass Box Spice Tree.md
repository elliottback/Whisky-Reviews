To facilitate tasting these little sample, and avoid oversharing, I'll be compiling mine in blocks of 5 and posting them here in an abbreviated format!  Please check out days [1 through 5](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/14d9m2/whiskymas_reviews_days_1_to_5/) and [6 - 10](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/14nd69/whiskymas_reviews_days_6_10/).

* **Finish:** brief

~~Not~~ a huge ~~fan~~ hater of Compass Box, I don't see any reason why this should exist.  It's like a ruined Talisker or an oversold thinned out Highland Park adultered with miscellaneous herbs.

**Rating: 62/100**
