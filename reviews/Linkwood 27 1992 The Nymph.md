**Linkwood 27 1992 "The Nymph: Blue Dun" / 46.9% / $138**

*Tasted with a drop of mineral water*

This is a 1992 single cask no 5282 of Linkwood, aged 27 years, and bottled at cask strength for Harry's Takaoka.  Bottle 188 of 300.  It was surprisingly listed for sale domestically on just 2 retailer's sites, and sold out in about 30 minutes.

Some additional information about this is available on [the original listing](https://www.wakatsuru.co.jp/archives/1865) and [this blog](http://whiskywarehouse.blog.jp/archives/1077415759.html).

* **Color:** old gold (0.6)
* **Nose:** citrus/lemon, oak, damp earth, peaches 
* **Taste:** very oaky, plain yoghurt, glue, a bit more lemon peel, some cardboard
* **Finish:** long and sweet, very woody; vanilla

Relaxing, but over-oaked.  I feel a bit like I'm chewing on my cutting board.

**Rating: 72/100**
