**9th Review: Glengoyne 17yr / 43% ABV / $49**

*tasted neat, then with a bit of filtered water*

* Color: dark and bright gold as light ripples through.  The bottle claims "natural colour", so no e150a caramel colouring is used.
* Nose: sweetness and fruit, some raisins with apple.  With water, floral alcohol.
* Taste: Smooth figgy pudding, water opens up fat almonds and orange peels fruit in honey
* Finish: Long and gentle, like pancakes with Canadian maple syrup

Despite all the cloying adjectives above, the Glengoyne 17 isn't terribly sweet.  It has some floral and fruity subtitleties, but also a great richness in the mouth and finish.  It's not as heavy as an Islay or Macallan sherry bomb, but it's pleasant. ** Extremely pleasant; a bit too straightforward, lacking in complexity.**

Glengoyne *claims* that their process produces a superior product:

> Unlike most other single malts Glengoyne has been preserving the essence of its flavour for decades by using air-dried barley rather than barley dried using harsh peat smoke. The result is a more subtle, complex whisky in which all of the delicate flavours are freely allowed to express themselves.

So [biomortis](http://www.reddit.com/user/biomortis/) will love this unpeated one ;)
