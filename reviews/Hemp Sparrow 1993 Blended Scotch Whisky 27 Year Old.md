**Hemp Sparrow 1993 Blended Scotch Whisky 27 Year Old / 45.2%**

*Tasted neat*

[This](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/193254/blended-scotch-whisky-1993-w-e) bottle from Japanese importer Whisk-E is minimal, it's under their somewhat "affordable" *Hemp Sparrow* line, and it's a Blended Scotch Whisky distilled in 1993, and aged in Sherry Butt #47 for 27 years.

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** sherried figs, stewed plum, icing sugar, ethanol, chlorine, and strawberry
* **Taste:** Christmas spice, thin-bodied red wine, jerky, sulphur, cream, and a little vanilla
* **Finish:** More vanilla now, fairly long, spiced wine

This was a bit thinner than I like, but it also had a lovely texture (something often overlooked in reviews).  Given that it was around the $150 mark, I'm not too put out by a reasonably decent age-statement blend.

**Rating: 80/100**
