**Talisker Distiller's Edition 2005 / 45.8%  ABV**

*Tasted neat*

[This Talisker Distiller's Edition](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/72895/talisker-2005) was distilled in 2005, bottled 2015 with the new "blue stripe" label.  Features a double maturation in Amoroso sherry casks of some indeterminate time.

* **Color:** russet (1.3)
* **Nose:** petrichor, canned fruit syrup, salt, white pepper, iodine, and rubber
* **Taste:** malty sherry, blueberries, pine sap, crème brulée, chocolate, and cinnamon
* **Finish:** long, black pepper and oily sweetness

This particular recent vintage of Talisker DE is still quite excellent, you get a really lovely "relaxing in the study with a book" profile, but the Amoroso finish is a bit thinner and less integrated than in the 2001.

**Rating: 89/100**
