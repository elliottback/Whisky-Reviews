**Nikka Miyagikyo 2004 From the Barrel / 51.4% / $30**

*Tasted neat*

I bumped into this 170ml "Kakubin" (角瓶 or square glass bottle) from Nikka Miyagikyo distillery, which dates to a distillery exclusive offered until 2004.  Later dates show 500ml square bottles and 170ml cylinders.  It is very hard to find anything around on this in Japanese language either, I only found mention of it here, which gives my tentative date:

[2007.04.29【日記】ニッカ仙台工場限定樽出し51度](https://www.sakedori.com/spn/s/syakkindaimaou/blog/14532.html):
> ３年前の角瓶バージョンです。
>
> "This is the Kakubin version from three years ago."

It differs from regular Nikka "From the Barrel" in that on the label it says "仙台工場樽出し 51度ウイスキー" or Sendai Factory "From the Barrel" Whiskey, "Sendai Factory" being the old name for Miyagikyo distillery.

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** mizunara, cigar smoke, pine needles, custard, and a little sherry
* **Taste:** thick and malty, vanilla milkshake, chestnut, and leather
* **Finish:** long and rich, dark chocolate

Every year Japanese whiskies are getting lighter in colour, casks are getting "seasoned", and age statements are going away as the few domestic distilleries try to keep up with global demand.  It's nice to try something from before Japanese whiskey was popular and oversold; this is a very nice, richer version of the current "From the Barrel". 

**Rating: 91/100**
