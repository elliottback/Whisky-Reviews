**Clynelish 2000 North Star "Lynch Isle" 20 Year Old / 53.3%**

*Tasted neat*

[This](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/171681/lynch-isle-2000-nss) unusual Clynelish was distilled in August 2000 and laid to rest in a Sherry Butt before finally being reracked into a Portuguese brandy butt for an unspecified amount of time and bottled October 2020.  The yield is an extremely massive 693 bottles.

* **Color:** russet (1.3)
* **Nose:** brandy over wax, salt spray, pineapple, and black pepper
* **Taste:** big bright waxy clynelish, candied oranges, gunpowder, red chillies, icing sugar, some subtle sherry
* **Finish:** long, spicy, dragonfruit

This is worth it just for the unusual combination, which I've never seen before, of ex-sherry matured Clynelish finished in a brandy cask.  It definitely gives it a not insignificant rum-spice punch and extra sweetness.  A real dessert dram!

**Rating: 87/100**
