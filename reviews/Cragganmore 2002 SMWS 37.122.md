**Cragganmore 2002 "Pure Magic" 16 Year Old SMWS 37.122 / 57.1% ABV / Â¥14,000**

*Tasted neat and with a bit of bottled water*

[This Cragganmore](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/134162/cragganmore-2002-smws-37122) is spent its first 13 years in an ex-bourbon hogshead, then another 3 in a heavy toast medium char virgin new oak hogshead.  The yield was 210 bottles.   

SMWS Japan describes it thus:

> Aromas of caramelised sugar and a hot cocoa drink with nougat whilst the taste neat had the intensity of dark and spicy pumpkin pie as well as chunky fig, apricot and prune cake. With a drop of water we were making damson jam as well as a dark fruit loaf, cinder toffee and roasted honey-glazed carrots. On the palate very different, at first plenty of ash and tobacco was soon followed by the zingy, sweet-tart finish of molasses-cinnamon syrup on pancakes.

I can't find any information on the web about it, so it's possible that this was a limited run for SMWS Japan only?

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** orange marmalade, wet yeast, maple syrup 
* **Taste:** rich, sugary, spice cake; woody shortbread cookies
* **Finish:** warm, long; roasted pistachios glazed with honey

This is a massive desert-bomb, but it's a little rough around the finish, and one-note.  It is extremely orangy!   Pleasant enough, but maybe more of a <$100 bottle in my view.

**Rating: 84/100**
