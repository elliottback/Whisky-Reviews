**Glenburgie 1998 Elixir 21 Year Old / 59.4%**

*Tasted neat*

[This Glenburgie](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/159185/glenburgie-1998-eld) was distilled on 08.10.1998 and laid to rest in ex-bourbon hogshead #900887 for 21 years before being bottled on 19.12.2019, yielding just 298 bottles.  Forming the heart of Ballentine's blends, it's a nice treat to try it as a single malt.

* **Color:** amber (0.7)
* **Nose:** cream, pineapple, mango, flaked pastry, and lots of papaya
* **Taste:** a little christmas spice, more tropical fruits, ginger, and asian pear
* **Finish:** very long, oak, some icing sugar, more fruit--peaches at the last

This is extremely fruity!  I struggled a bit to score it, as it's tropical-fruits to the max, but it also is nicely aged, and quite delicious.  Since it's now the summer and 34Â° right now here in Tokyo, I'm going to let my personal circumstances take it up to 7; an excellent dram for a hot day.

**Rating: 7/10**
