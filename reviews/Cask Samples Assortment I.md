**Assorted Cask Samples: I / CS / Free**

*All are tasted starting neat, adding water if necessary, in a blender's glass*

These are samples of some various casks that are/were available for purchase on the secondary market.  I will be taking a look at them from a different perspective than usual, more to understand the wood/distillery character over time, as all of these are quite young.  I have also anonymized the sellers' / cask-specific information as well; all of these are fairly young, and probably in the Â£4-12,000 range.

I will start these in order from lightest-to-darkest (barring a better random sorting system), and will use a compressed scale from 1-5:

    (1) No good at all; ruinous; unsalvageable 
    (2) Bad, but maybe it just needs more time
    (3) OK; could be fine with a few more years
    (4) Good; nice stuff, you could bottle it now, or give it a bit more time
    (5) Perfect; why is this still in the cask??

**Glenrothes 2009 ex-bourbon hogshead / 65.3%**

The colour is extremely pale, like Chardonnay.  Huge alcoholic nose, wood shavings, estery new-make character; grape drink.  Taste is peppery, with hints of grain alcohol, some sweetness and vanilla into the finish.

Verdict: **2-**: this is juice that is sitting in some 4th or 5th fill ex-bourbon cask, and could probably use a re-rack into a refill hogshead.

**Benriach 5 year barrel #100 / 60%**

Colour here is better, a light pastry golden.  Nose is floral, just a hint of ethanol; cacao and walnuts.  The flavour is amazingly sweet, treacle, honey-covered peanuts, and banana bread.

Verdict: **4-**: this is a great first or refill barrel, the distillery character really shines, and oakiness from aging is just starting to come along.  This will be amazing now or in 10 years.

**Glenrothes 2006 12 Yr #5454 / 67.1%**

This is ex-sherry of some kind, the colour is reddish amber, much deeper.  The ABV is insane and the nose comes out quite new-makey, rum raisins and moss.  Flavour is much better than the last Glenrothes, nice fully integrated sherry, some oakiness, great finish.  Raisins, stewed berries.

Verdict: **3+**: this still needs a little more time to be perfect, especially to round off the hot feel, but it's coming along quite nicely, and the ABV gives it legs to run.

**Blair Athol 2012 #302993 / 57.9%**

Light golden colour, like malted barley.  Nose is interesting, lots of bread/yeast, citrus, and plum blossoms, altogether  a very clean profile.  Taste is fantastic, with baked pears, and icing sugar that opens up with a little water to highlight a butter-vanilla finish. 

Verdict: **4+**: this is already absolutely lovely stuff at 8/9 years old, and running it up to 12 or 15 would potentially be perfection.

**Linkwood 2010 #306780 / 56.4%**

This one is a little special, it's my cask!  Colour is dark gold, nose of varnish, sliced apples, and lemoncake.  In the mouth, vanilla oakiness, creamy egg-tarts, and coastal salt spray.  The finish is gorgeous, long, sweet, and sticky.

Verdict: **4**: this is getting very nice, it might be ready in a couple more years.
