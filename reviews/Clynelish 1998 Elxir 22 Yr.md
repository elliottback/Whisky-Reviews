**Clynelish "Marriage of Casks" 22 Year Old / 55.4% / 38,000å†† (JPY)**

*Tasted neat, with a drop of water*

[This](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/167022/clynelish-22-year-old-eld) 22 year old Clynelish was created by marrying a single sherry butt with a single hogshead; there is nothing else known about the bottle from the label!  Normally we want a bit of a store with a bottle, but Elixir is giving us nothing here but the bare-bones paucity of "hey: Clynelish", and that whisper is enough to get the aficionados immediately salivating. 

* **Color:** russet (1.3)
* **Nose:** leather, sherry, grape jelly, musky stone fruits; baked pie crust 
* **Taste:** pipe smoke, candle wax, crisp pear; mead, truffle fries, and almond syrup
* **Finish:** long, minerally, fresh baked bread and honey

This is a fantastic, soft, fruity Clynelish, and the marriage of casks works well to sweeten up the bourbon hogshead, which would taste a lot like GoT Clynelish, but with more of the richness of age.

**Rating: 90/100**
