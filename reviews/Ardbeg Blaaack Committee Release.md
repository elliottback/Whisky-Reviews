**Ardbeg Blaaack Committee Release / 50.7% ABV**

*Tasted neat*

[Ardbeg Blaaack](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/149464/ardbeg-blaaack) is more fun; this is the Committee 20th Anniversary Release at a nice punch 50.7% ABV, and a New Zealand Pinot Noir wine cask treatment.  It's also NAS but probably a nice blend of younger Ardbeg, not the boring old stuff ;)

The box screed reads:

    Our whisky creators have rounded up the finest Pinot Noir wine casks from New Zealand to mature
    a celebratory dram that knits together velvety summer FRUIT PUDDING and BITTER CHERRY, with a deeper
    edge of SOOT and Ardbeg's hallmark SMOKE.  Truly a whisky apart.

This whisky is non-chill-filtered!

* **Color:** chestnut (1.2)
* **Nose:** sweet cherries, hickory smoke, iodine, apple cobbler, and a little peat
* **Taste:** salty Ardbeg sea spray turns quickly into a syrupy, sweet, confection; extremely oily texture, tinned peaches
* **Finish:** long, dessert wine, charcoal smoke, and ice cream

This is a brilliant dessert Islay, a little one-note, but delicious.

**Rating: 89/100**
