**Balvenie (Burnside) 1991 27 Year - Cadenhead's Single Cask / 42.2% / $150**

*Tasted neat*

This Balvenie is very similar to [this release](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/142510/burnside-1991-ca); here I have distilled 1991, bottled 2019, with 144 bottles at a bit lower ABV.  This was bottled for Whisk-e/Y's Cask Tokyo. 

* **Color:** deep gold (0.8)
* **Nose:** acetone, tropical flowers, grass, vanilla
* **Taste:** curry powder, cut unripe white pear, cinnamon, legumes 
* **Finish:** long, cloying, sweet

 This is a tasty bourbon-cask Balvenie, not a hint of cardboard.  Quite nice!

**Rating: 87/100**
