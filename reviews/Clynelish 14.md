**Clynelish 14 / 46% / $60**

*Tasted neat*

Clynelish, the famed Brora's twin, has finally got a few OB releases on the market, and this one, aged 14 years in ex-bourbon/sherry casks, is quite affordable.  This almost certainly coloured and chill-filtered.

* **Color:** e150a
* **Nose:** ethanol, creme brulee, jasmine, mint, light peatiness
* **Taste:** rich and oily, sherry, salty ocean breeze, and lemon;some classic waxy character
* **Finish:** medium, some of the sherry comes out a little more,

This is a lovely OB of Clynelish--it's got a lot of the floral, fruity notes and waxy mouthtaste you find in the more exalted IBs.  The notes are not as pure as those, because this is younger, and a vatting.  Also, I quite appreciate the higher 46% ABV in a standard bottling!

**Rating: 87/100**
