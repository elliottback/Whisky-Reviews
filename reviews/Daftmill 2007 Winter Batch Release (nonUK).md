**Daftmill 2007 Winter Batch Release (non UK) / 46% ABV / $170**

*Tasted neat*

Back with the [2007 -> 2020 Asia Batch Daftmill](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/150037/daftmill-2007), we've hit 12 years of age, in a limited run of 1685 bottles, but surprisingly still in heavy stock at retailers all over Japan!  Is the small-batch farm distillery getting better with age?  Let's find out.

* **Color:** yellow gold (0.55)
* **Nose:** caramels, mixed nuts, custard, grape must; cotton candy
* **Taste:** creamy oak and walnuts, nutmeg, vanilla, chocolate malt balls, and a little orange peel 
* **Finish:** long, sweet, and a bit floral

Absolutely delightful, it's an improvement on the previous batch I had (which itself was great); it's a little less nutty, and a bit oakier and creamier.  Extremely quaffable; I'll have to pick up a few more.

**Rating: 92/100**
