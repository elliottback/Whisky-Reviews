**Bunnahabhain 2012 Signatory Vintage Cask Strength 9 Year Old / 65.6%**

*Tasted neat*

This [rather young Bunnahabhain](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/210068/bunnahabhain-2012-sv) was distilled on 4/11/2012 and left in first fill sherry butt #900606 for 9 years before being bottled for Signatory Vintage's "Cask Strength" line on 4/9/2022.  So, it's just two days shy of being a 10 year old?  I guess there was a scheduling reason to not wait the two days; also their fans probably don't care.

This is bottle #389 of 624, and this is also natural colour.

* **Color:** brown sherry (1.9)
* **Nose:** oloroso sherry, almonds, caramel, brownies, and bubbalicious chewing gum 
* **Taste:** a very classic Sherried Bunnahabhain, nutty and chewy, texas BBQ and roasted honey
* **Finish:** long; dry sherry, black pepper, pipe smoke, blackcurrant; some phenols

I am a little split on the call for Oloroso as I'm also getting some funky notes reminiscent of Palo Cortado.  Fans of Bunnahabhain will probably enjoy this, although I feel like it is a little bit young, and before its prime.  I would have liked to see some oakier notes develop here.  Still, quite good.

**Rating: 6/10**
