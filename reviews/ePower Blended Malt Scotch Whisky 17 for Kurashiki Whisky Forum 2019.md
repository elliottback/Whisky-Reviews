**ePower Blended Malt Scotch Whisky 17 for Kurashiki Whisky Forum 2019 / 46.6% / Â¥15,000**

*Tasted neat*

[This is a rare bottle](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/154186/blended-malt-scotch-whisky-17-year-old-ep) of just 120 released for 2019 Kurashiki Whiskey Forum, held in Okayama prefecture Japan.  Not much is known except that it's 17 years old, and from a Sherry Butt. 

* **Color:** auburn (1.5)
* **Nose:** nail polish, roast pears, sherry, molasses, and strawberry jam
* **Taste:** christmas spice, malt, cola, and a little tannin
* **Finish:** slightly minty, long residual sweetness 

Things that I liked about this blend include an age statement, higher than 40/43% ABV, and the small-scope release.  However, it's a very boring sherry blend without much richness or complexity, and priced at least three times what it should be.  If I hadn't been forced to buy it to get a very desired bottle as a bundle, I don't think I'd have picked this up.

**Rating: 76/100**
