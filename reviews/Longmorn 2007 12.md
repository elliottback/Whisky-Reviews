**Longmorn 2007 12 Year "The Distillery Reserve Collection" / 59.4% / $123**

*Tasted neat / with some bottled mineral water*

I haven't tried any of *The Distillery Reserve Collection* yet, a relatively new Chivas Brothers' owned distilleries OB offering. [This bottle](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/136493/longmorn-2007) is a 12 year Longmorn distilled 11 May 2007 and bottled 13 June 2019 from first-fill sherry butt 46519, bottle 153 of 900--they've tried to stretch out the line with a smaller 50cl size, but it is at least natural colour / cask strength.

* **Color:** old oak (1.8)
* **Nose:** stewed prunes, white pepper, portabello mushroom, hint of citrus
* **Taste:** extremely rich sherry, oily and a tint of mealiness; mint 
* **Finish:** long; campfire smoke, dry fruit, chocolate

This definitely needs water to open up, but it's excellent.  It's only 12 years, but in a proper first-fill sherry cask, it's a bomb.  This butt would make an excellent 20+ YR second-fill contribution, hopefully Chivas doesn't try to milk it again for a quick turnaround ;)

**Rating: 95/100**
