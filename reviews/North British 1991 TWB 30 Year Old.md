[This North British](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/199935/north-british-1991-twb) was laid to rest in first-fill palo cortado hogshead #TWB1023 in 1991 and bottled in February 2021 after 30 years.  Mine is bottle #92 of 159.  The back reads:

> Lunar sweet sherry, popcorn clusters, planetary ripe pears, tasted cinnamon nebular, telescopic double cream with supernova strawberries. Protoplanetary runny honey circling runaway burnt cedar shavings.

* **Color:** burnished (1.1)
* **Nose:** grainy ethanol, limes and tropical fruit, freshly-sawn planks, and sea breeze 
* **Taste:** strawberry, cream, nutmeg, and spiced wine; some butter and salt
* **Finish:** brief, but fruity and rich

This is a really lovely, soft and fruity grain.  No real complaints, it's great.
