**Nikka Miyagikyo Sherry and Sweet / 55% / Sample**

*Tasted neat, then with a little bottled water*

Nikka's Miyagikyo distillery was founded by Masataka Taketsuru 30 years after Yoichi in 1989, out of a desire to expand the scope of Nikka's blending operations.  Situated at the junction of two rivers, Miyagikyo operates different, larger pot stills than Yoichi, with a longer distillation time from indirect steam heating. Also, Nikka's only 2 Coffey stills for grain distillation were relocated there in 1999. 

There is not much about this, except that it's single malt -- so no grain made it in -- and it's been aged in Sherry barrels for an unspecified length of time.

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** alcohol, stewed plums, moss, oloroso sherry; vanilla and milk
* **Taste:** soft sherry, gunpowder, bubble gum; macadamia nuts, mizunara
* **Finish:** the finish is long and sweet, some citrus; pine sap

This is a fairly uncomplicated sherry bomb, with also some hints of Japanese whiskey-making provenance, as it is surely a sherry-blended type NAS product, using some ex-Sherry, some imported ex-Bourbon, and domestic virgin oak casks.

If you find one for a cheap enough price, go for it!  It won't blow you away, but also, it won't disappoint you too badly.

**Rating: 80/100**
