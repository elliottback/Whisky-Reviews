**Highland Park 2000 Thomson Brothers 19 Year / 57.1% ABV**

*Tasted neat; with mineral water*

[This Highland Park](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/157820/orkney-2000-pst) was distilled in 2000 and bottled in 2020 at 19 years old from a refill hogshead.  Just 343 bottles, it is a mystery island/orkney single malt -- which can only be Highland Park.

* **Color:** burnished (1.1)
* **Nose:** musty lemons, coastal peat, custard pudding; salt 
* **Taste:** spicy earl grey tea, white pepper, confectionary lavender; peat 
* **Finish:** quite long and oily, it lingers zestily with a bit of oak-aged honey

This is a very floral/citrusy Highland Park, and I quite like it.  It's also quite sweet, and young fiesty elements emerge from a general feeling of proper aged oak.

**Rating: 90/100**
