**Caperdonich 1995 Asta Morris 20 Year Old / 48%**

*Tasted neat*

[This is the first Caperdonich](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/71013/caperdonich-1995-am) I've tried, cask AM 021 and bottle 13/302 from an ex-bourbon barrel.  

Caperdonich was built as "Glen Grant #2" but ran only four years before closing until 1965 when Glenlivet took it over.  It ran until 2002 when its new buyer Pernod Ricard closed it, and was demolished in 2010. 

* **Color:** yellow gold (0.5)
* **Nose:** floral, baker's yeast, hint of lemon?
* **Taste:** cardboard, artificial strawberries, canadian bacon, and hot nail polish 
* **Finish:** a little sweetener, medium; some cream, wet dough

This one feels a little hot, despite 20 years in the cask, and is not a flavour profile I enjoy.  It's a mainstay in Chivas, which I am not hugely a fan of, so that is at least consistent.

**Rating: 71/100**
