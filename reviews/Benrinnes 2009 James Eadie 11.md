**Benrinnes 2009 James Eadie 11 / 56.1% / Â£90**

*Tasted neat, with a bit of mineral water*

[This Benrinnes](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/166172/benrinnes-2009-je) is a bit of a strange one, here's the bottle label:

* Bottle 133/338, cask No. 354550
* Distilled 08/06/2009 and bottled 2020
* Matured in European Oak
* Finished in a first-fill PX hogshead for 7 months

This now looks like cola from a very very wet PX finish; I also had the somewhat fragile/dry cork break on me!

* **Color:** old oak (1.8)
* **Nose:** dunnage warehouse, sherry, cinnamon, heather; malty cereal 
* **Taste:** malty, estery sherry bomb, pink bubble gum, cola; hot pears, star anise, and pine
* **Finish:** long, sweet finish, sweet BBQ sauce

This is a really good example of a young hot Benrinnes that you want to make a sherry bomb so you stick in a wet PX finish for 7 months and turn out a cola-whiskey that doesn't have a lot of depth or complexity, but looks quite dark.

**Rating: 72/100**
