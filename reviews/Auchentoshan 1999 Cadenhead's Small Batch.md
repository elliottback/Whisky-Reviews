**Auchentoshan 1999 Cadenhead's Small Batch / 52.4% ABV**

*Tasted neat*

[This Auchentoshan](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/113729/auchentoshan-1999-ca) Lowland single malt was distilled in 1999 and bottled in 2018, 19 years old.  It is cask strength, non-chill-filtered, and natural colour.  Just 258 bottles from an interesting twist of
both a Bourbon Hogshead and a Ch√¢teau Lafite french wine cask!

The tasting notes from Cadenhead's read:

    Nose: Red cola, beef stock cubes and strawberries.
    Palate: Red fruits, banana skin. Slightly waxy.
    Finish: Cherries with tannins from the wine coming through. Also some  menthol notes.

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** craft cola, cranberry, ginger, pizza sauce, and juniper
* **Taste:** waxy, chewy red wine; brighter fruit notes of strawberry and banana, maple syrup
* **Finish:** long, vanilla ice cream with a maraschino cherry and sprig of mint

I'm actually a little bit surprised with Cadenhead's, the bottle notes on this one are spot on!

This is interesting, and probably a one off because of that expensive full-term wine cask.  I'll have to try some ex-bourbon releases in the future to figure out if this is a fluke, or I really like Auchentoshan.

**Rating: 7/10**
