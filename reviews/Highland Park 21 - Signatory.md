**Highland Park 21 - Signatory / 55.6% ABV / ~$100**

*Tasted neat, w/bottled water*

This lovely bottle from Signatory's **Cask Strength Collection** was distilled in 1990, and aged 21 years before being bottled in 2012.  It was matured in a sherry butt, bottle $380/395, from cask #15694.  70cl, natural colour.

* **Color:** a pretty sullen golden yellow
* **Nose:** oily, grassy, quite alcoholic; tart green apples
* **Taste:** lemon zested christmas cake, alkaline gasoline fluid, fresh-baked cinnamon buns
* **Finish:** long: marshmellows, candy/sherry, quite clean

Definitely not a first-fill sherry butt, the spirit is too golden, and tastes more like a bourbon cask with a quick rest in the sherry before bottling.  Still, better than HP12/18, although not nearly as good as the incredibly rich 25 year old OB.

For anyone wondering if Signatory is a good IB--if you can afford it, and the product is at cask strength, I can't recommend it more.

**Rating: 81/100**
