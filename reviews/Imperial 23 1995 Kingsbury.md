**Imperial 23 1995 Kingsbury / 52.7% ABV / ï¿¥24,345 (~$225)**

*Tasted neat*

This is an [IB Imperial](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/145880/imperial-1995-kb) of 167 bottles, 118 which were allocated to the domestic Japan market.  Cask #50407 was matured in a hogshead.

I have not reviewed any Imperial yet, but I like it--it's a rich, creamy, malty dram similar to Littlemill.  Drinking with my TW friend we've tried a few, and I quite like them.

* **Color:** canary
* **Nose:** rotted spinach, egg custard, creme brulee, cough syrop
* **Taste:** high, round cream, a light grassiness, in the mid-range there's peaches and some apple
* **Finish:** extremely creamy and long, deep warmth; apricot, and malty

Think like a super-creamy/slightly-fruity Longmorn and you've got Imperial, at least this one.  I'm growing quite fond of the shuttered distillery, so if you have any recommendations for non-closed, and therefore, not super-expensive whiskies that have a similar profile, please let me know!

**Rating: 92/100**
