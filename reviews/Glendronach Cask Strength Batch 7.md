* **Color:** light brown

* **Taste:** toasted marshmallow and port wine, leather, crushed peppermint, and  blackberry
* **Finish:** very long, deep, sweet with a hint of salt

Sadly I bought this in person quite some time ago and don't recall the price, except for the impression that I thought it was a good deal, so probably around the $70 mark.

This is not a sherry bomb, this is a very lovely sherried whisky that is subtle, clean, flavourful, and layered with complexities.  If you see a bottle around under $100, it's a definite buy.  Also--how do other batches compare, if you'd had them before?

**Rating: 90/100**
