**Bunnahabhain Abhainn Araig / 50.8% / Â£90**

*Tasted neat*

[This Bunnahabhain](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/203498/bunnahabhain-abhainn-araig) is a special no-age-statement (NAS) bottling for Feis Ile 2022.  The name means "Araig River" in Scots Gaelic, and it was created from the unusual combination of ex-bourbon casks, Pedro Ximenez sherry casks and sherry **octaves**.  

* **Color:** chestnut (1.2)
* **Nose:** salt spray, iodine, oak, currants, and leather
* **Taste:** oily; with big dry sherry, salted mixed nuts, baked pie crust, and nutmeg
* **Finish:** medium, rich; buttercream and oak

Despite being NAS, this is bottled at a higher proof, and it has a lot more of the classic bunny flavour profile, with enough oakiness and age to it to lend complexity.  While it probably (definitely?) includes some fairly young spirit in the vatting, the sherry octaves did their job to balance everything out.

Interestingly, this is widely available still from retailers like [The Whiskey Exchange](https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/p/33286/bunnahabhain-abhainn-araig-feis-ile-2022), [Master of Malt](https://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/bunnahabhain/bunnahabhain-abhainn-araig-feis-ile-2022-whisky/), and [Whisky Online](https://www.whisky-online.com/products/bunnahabhain-abhainn-araig-feis-ile-2022), probably because of the higher-than-normal price-point.

**Rating: 6/10**
