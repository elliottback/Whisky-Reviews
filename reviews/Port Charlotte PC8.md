**Port Charlotte PC8 "Ar Duthchas" / 60.5% ABV**

*tasted neat, w/bottled water*

Massive.  Just *look* at that ABV!  I like Cask Strength and I canna lie...

* **Color:** Slightly darker than An Turas Mor, almost a bit reddish
* **Nose:** cabernet wine, truffles, heavy vanilla
* **Taste:** boom! peatshot; tramping through muddy shore, bits of dried fruit along the way, forlorn figs, to arrive at a beach bonfire
* **Finish:** long and almost sherried; malty

This is the older brother, and 8 year old Port Charlotte Expression from Bruichladdich and it's a great sign of what's to come.  It's bottled at Cask Strength, a blistering ~61% ABV that is absolutely wonderful.  You're allowed to add some water to this one; it brings out heather in the nose, leather on the tongue. and more oak/smoke on the finish

I highly recommend this--and the other numbered PC releases, as they are great.
