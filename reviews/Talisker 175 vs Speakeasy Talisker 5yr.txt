**Talisker 175^th Anniversary / 45.8% / $50**

*Tasted neat*

This is a special vatting of NAS Talisker which promises some "very old" casks, bottled in 2005 for their 175th anniversary.

* **Color:** a bit e150a?
* **Nose:** your gran-gran's flat, plum, anise, honey granola, with a bit of petrichor
* **Taste:** spice, caramel, toffee, salt spray, lemons, and malty smoke
* **Finish:** crusty leather, warm, and reassuring oak

A very drinkable, *smooth* production from Talisker, rich and restrained compared to their fiery 10 year old.  Pleasant, sipping dram, with some nuance, and flavour--true to their marketing, you do feel a bit of age in this one!  I think it may be better than the 18 year old, but I don't have a sample around to check--if anything, it's probably close to equal.  One great thing about this vatting is that there is no seperation of layers, it's fully integrated.

**Rating: 87/100**

**Talisker "The Speakeasy" 5 yr / 58.2% / $60**

*Tasted neat*

This is a KLWines cask-strength single-cask edition of 345 bottles of extremely young Talisker, bottled 2013.

* **Color:** bleached straw
* **Nose:** phenolic, burnt plastic, vomiting grass, verdant bilious limes, a tingling nose
* **Taste:** sweating horses, hayseed, hints of treacle; (adding water) lemon-tart, cream, and bitter melon
* **Finish:** burning, quick smokey body blows, unripe bananas, unspecified acidity, (adding water) butter

I gave up halfway through and added water, which improves this--if you have a bottle, it gets significantly better with a little water.

There are a couple interesting things about this:

1. Young Talisker tastes nothing like Talisker 10, it has so many off notes, and is incredibly hot.
1. The quality of spirit between Talisker at 5 years and Kilchoman is significantly different.  Kilchoman is amazing young, and I hope that carries into age.

I would rate this as undrinkable for a scotch, but nonetheless unique.

**Rating: 47/100**
