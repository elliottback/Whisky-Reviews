**Glenfarclas 12 CS (Batch 1) / 59.9% ABV/ $100?**

*Tasted with a bunch of filtered tap water*

This lovely highland is a 12 year of the Glenfarclas sherrybomb family, and at CASK STRENGTH.  I haven't seen this run before, and I have had a chance to try the fantastic 21 yr CS too.  So I am excited :)

According to whiskybase, this is a limited run of 600 for the Japan market.

* **Color:** brown
* **Nose:** stewed prunes, cigarette ash, sherry, burnt leather, sulphur
* **Taste:** brown sugar, very sulphury, cinnamon buns, black pepper
* **Finish:** long, fresh maple syrup over ice

This is sortof a "family casks" style Glenfarclas; it's over the top, but more like a matured 105.  Sulphur notes are pretty extreme, so if you are sensitive this might not be for you.  I feel like this is what you'd get if you toasted s'mores over a first fill sherry cask!

**Rating: 86/100**
