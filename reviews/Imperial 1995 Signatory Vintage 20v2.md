**Imperial 20 1995 Signatory Vintage / 51.0%**

*Tasted neat*

[This](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/78149/imperial-1995-sv) is a lovely 1995 Imperial from Signatory's Cask Strength collection, matured in an ex-bourbon hogshead, yielding just 257 bottles at cask strength.  Not all bottles have been drunk, you can [still find it out there for ridiculous money](https://www.thewhiskybarrel.com/imperial-20-year-old-1995-signatory-cask-strength-50154).

* **Color:** burnished (1.1)
* **Nose:** creamy pears, green apple, pineapple, grass, and kiwifruit 
* **Taste:** cardboard and szechuan chili pepper, custard, and mustard
* **Finish:** honey on tart apples, medium

A solid but immature Imperial, I would have liked to see more woodiness present.

I cannot say for certain, but I have the impression that water would absolutely ruin this one.

**Rating: 84/100**
