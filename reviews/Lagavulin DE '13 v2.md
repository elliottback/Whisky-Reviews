**Lagavulin Distiller's Edition / 43% ABV / 2013**

*Tasted neat*

I've reviewed this once before, but here we have the 2013 edition, distilled in 1997.  It is batch 4 of 502, an enormous annual release of tens of thousands of bottles.  Sometime between 2011 and they updated the old black-bottle labels to a new creamy green.

This has been matured in PX (Pedro Ximenez) sherry casks for a second barrel maturation.

* **Color:** caramel e150a
* **Nose:** hot, chinese baijiu, salt and pepper, woody peat
* **Taste:** campire smoke roasting smores, sickly sherry, citrus
* **Finish:** serious sherry, figs, glazed sugar, smoke

This is quite a pleasant, evening dram.  Great with a book.  It's a bit out of balanced--the sherry doesn't take as much as it should, as I find with all the sherried Lagavulins, but it does take something out of the pure spirit, muddying and diluting the Islay.

**Rating: 82/100**
