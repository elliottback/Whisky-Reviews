**Glenlivet 15 Year Sherry Cask / 40%**

*Tasted neat*

[This is a Taiwan exclusive](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/148986/glenlivet-15-year-old) 15 year OB Glenlivet, matured in ex-Oloroso sherry casks and bottled at 40% ABV.

* **Color:** burnt umber (1.7)
* **Nose:** pine sap, spice, cough syrup, icing sugar, cinnamon
* **Taste:** thin sherry, leather, honey, mint, and raisins
* **Finish:** fleeting

Inoffensive but lacking complexity, much like the other 13 year old Taiwan exclusive sherry cask Glenlivet, I would save my money for something cask strength in the future.

**Rating: 76/100**
