**The Whisky Trail Rockabilly Hoedown Blended Malt 19 Year / 45.0%**

*Tasted neat*

[This blend from Elixir Distillers](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/184935/blended-malt-scotch-whisky-2001-eld) was distilled 30.08.2001 and bottled on 11.11.2020 to yield some indeterminate number of casks, from a Sherry Butt, reference number 56.  The series features American musicians, in this case Jerry Lee Lauter and the pun "Whole Lotta Whisky Goin' On" and a quote "Whisky is a bond for friendship" on the label.  

* **Color:** brown sherry (1.9)
* **Nose:** spice, honeysuckle, candy sugar, glog, and cinnamon
* **Taste:** malty, grassy, rich chocolate, dried figs, and pipe smoke 
* **Finish:** long, evolving burnt sugar and berries

There is definitely a good hit of Longmorn in here!  This is exactly what you want from a nice blended sherry malt, it's redolent with richness and flavour, just escaping the one-noteness a lot of sherry bombs have to attain a level of complexity that puts it solidly above your average blend.

**Rating: 87/100**
