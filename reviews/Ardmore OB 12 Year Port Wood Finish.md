**Ardmore 12 Year Old Port Wood Finish / 46% ABV**

*Tasted neat*

Part of the core range, [this 12 Year Old Ardmore](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/73170/ardmore-12-year-old) is double matured in ex-bourbon American oak before receiving a European oak port cask finish.  We get two nods to scotch whisky drinkers: it is slightly up-proof at 46%, and it is non-chill filtered.  It is probably not entirely natural colour, but there is a certain ruddiness from the port casks that shows through.

* **Color:** 1.5 (auburn)
* **Nose:** classic Ardmore, sea spray, smoke, salt, with stone fruits and BBQ brisket
* **Taste:** fresh strawberries, blackberry syurp, peat smoke, fresh spring water, petrichor, and cherries
* **Finish:** long, some ash, honey and oak; strawberry 

Delicately peated whisky and a port finish?  Sign me up, this is amazing.  Taking the brutal, but delicious, highland peat of Ardmore and softening it *just a bit* in port pipes is brilliant!  Also this is quite affordable, I may stock up.

**Rating: 7/10**
