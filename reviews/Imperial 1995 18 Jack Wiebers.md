Whiskybase seems to think this is a 15 year old, in which case I am superbly impressed, but the bottle dates suggest it's an 18 year old, which is right about where I would place it myself.

Interestingly, this has a misprint that affected a couple dozen of the original bottles.  Least peaty Islay ever!

**Rating: 87/100**
