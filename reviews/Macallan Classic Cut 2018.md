**Macallan Classic Cut 2018 / 51.2% / $165**

*Tasted with some mineral water*

I bought this on auction because I was feeling nostalgic about the old Macallan NAS CS releases, of which I bought by the caseload 7 or 8 years ago when they could be had cheap, hoping it would recreate the magic.

The bottle claims that it's natural colour, and:

    Matured exclusively in hand-picked sherry seasoned oak casks from Jerez, Spain 
    & bottled to reveal the extraordinary character of a timeless spirit

That's right, these are not Sherry Solera casks used for aging Sherry for any real production purpose, but casks they've knocked together and "seasoned" with Oloroso Sherry for some indeterminate amount of time--probably months not years.

There is also a horrible plastic cap + holographic tamper seal + Polish tax seal on it. 

* **Color:** chestnut (1.25)
* **Nose:** fruitcake, cinnamon, dry sherry, molasses, and beef jerky
* **Taste:** figs, sherry's a bit thin, alcohol is a bit hot, oatmeal, orange peel, some butyric acid  
* **Finish:** medium, spice and tannins, grapes 

A thinner, less integrated version of the old Macallan CS, it's definitely a lot lighter in colour, and hasn't been given enough time in the wood to really develop significant complexity.

**Rating: 83/100**
