**Sullivan's Cove French Oak / 47.5% ABV**

*Tasted with a drop of water*

Thanks to /u/UncleTobys/ for the sample, this whisky is from Tasmania, aged in French port casks, which should be a special treat!  A bottle runs $100-200, [$116 from KLWines if you live in the USA](https://www.klwines.com/detail.asp?sku=1113023).

* **Color:** allegedly natural color, a deep burnt gold
* **Nose:** vanilla cream, lilac, summer heat
* **Taste:** salt kippers, lemon-meringue, klondike bar, leather, supple grass
* **Finish:** quick, nutty, with sandalwood highs

This is really a fantastic whisky, much like what I wish an oak-aged whisky could be--clearly it's been rounded off by its special port casks, but damn, the French are doing it right.  It's like an oak-aged whisky made special, rounder, and fuller, without any harsh wood notes to bother you.  

This dram doesn't disappoint!

**Rating: 93/100**
