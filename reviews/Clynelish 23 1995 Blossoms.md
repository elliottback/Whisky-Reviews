**Clynelish 23 1995 Blossoms / 47.2% / $315**

*Tasted neat*

I tried [a dram of this at Bar Cask Strength](https://www.cask-s.com/) in Tokyo, mostly because my Japanese is not so great, and the label is very very pretty.

Distilled in 1995, and bottled in 2019, this 23 year old Clynelish was aged in a Hogshead.  It is a Whisk-E bottling for the Japan domestic market.  No indication of how many bottles were produced.

* **Color:** very light
* **Nose:** malty, fresh fruits, honeysuckle, dunnage warehouse and pineapples, burnt sugar; a little vinegar
* **Taste:** effervescent and floral, big waxiness, green delicious apples, fresh-baked bread with ham, and custard
* **Finish:** long and clean, like a fresh fruit tarte

I'm very much a fan of this Clynelish, it's easily the tastiest dram I've had in the last year!

**Rating: 97/100**
