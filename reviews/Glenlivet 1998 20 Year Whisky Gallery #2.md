**Secret Speyside 1998 20 Years - Whiskey Gallery #2 / 49.8% / Â¥16,000**

*Tasted neat*

[This is a mysterious ex-bourbon barrel](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/160863/secret-speyside-distillery-1998-w-e) #4406964 was distilled in 1998 and bottled in 2019, with just 297 bottles available.  This was exclusively bottled for Whisk-E Japan, and they've let slip it's a Glenlivet:

    Secret Speyside No.2 1998 was founded in 1824 and registered as the first government in Scotland.
    It is known as a distillery with a floral aroma, but it has a feeling of more aging than the stated age.

Domestically, it is not sold out: you can find it [here](https://sekiya.shop/items/5eda00e8cee9ea25f215196f), [here](http://www.e-yoshinoya.co.jp/whisk-e.html), [here](https://item.rakuten.co.jp/cbeer/19120802/), [here](https://mukawa-spirit.com/?pid=147413532), [here](https://www.yamaichi-mac.com/shopdetail/000000014955/), and [here](http://www.gohiikido.jp/fs/gohiiki/gd3716).  Or for 280 Euro [here](https://www.whiskyfoundation.com/product/speyside-20-year-old-no-2-1998/).

* **Color:** burnished (1.1)
* **Nose:** some mint, soft heather, black licorice, and toffee
* **Taste:** lemon throat lozenges, coffee grounds, oily tannic whipped cream
* **Finish:** long, lemon zest and bourbon oak

This is immensely quaffable, and I agree that it's a very stately expression of Glenlivet for 20 years old.  The abv is quite low for cask-strength fills of that age, so it must have had a fairly active cask at play.

**Rating: 90/100**
