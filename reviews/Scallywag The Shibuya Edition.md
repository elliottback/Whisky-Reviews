**Scallywag - The Shibuya Edition / 48%**

*Tasted neat*

[Scallywag The Shibuya Edition](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/140753/scallywag-the-shibuya-edition) is Douglas Laing's 100% ex-Sherry casks Speyside blend with a nice label inspired by some of the landmarks of downtown Shibuya Tokyo, including girl's fashion shop Shibuya 109 and the zebra crossing named "Shibuya Scramble".

From the [Blender](https://visionwineandspirits.com/project/douglas-laing-scallywag/):

> Scallywag is a Small Batch bottling created using only the finest Speyside Malts including, amongst others, spirit distilled at Mortlach, Macallan and Glenrothes Distilleries. Bottled at 46% alcohol strength and proudly non chill-filtered, Scallywag embodies all that is Speyside Malt Scotch Whisky â€“ beautifully sherried, richly spiced and truly charming.

* **Color:** burnished (1.1)
* **Nose:** burnt plastic, chemical glues, pine needles, camphor, salt, and lemon butter
* **Taste:** warm sherry, custard, some cut grass and orange peel oil, honey-mustard, and ripe apple  
* **Finish:** medium; wax fruits give way to spice

There is a very Johnny Walker double-black-esque soft sherried blend that tastes much better than it noses.  It is undoubtedly quite young, and while you get that full-on in the nose, in the mouth it's fairly delicate and charming.

I'm not rushing out to buy more of this limited edition, even with the +2% ABV over the regular one, but it's certainly not a bad blend.

**Rating: 75/100**
