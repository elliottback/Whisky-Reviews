**Glenfarclas 15 Year Old 95 Proof for The Whisky Exchange / 54.2% ABV / Â£90**

*Tasted neat / with some bottled water*

[This Glenfarclas](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/234852/glenfarclas-15-year-old#whisky-note-holder) is a 15 year old exclusive from ex-Sherry casks for The Whisky Exchange (TWE), one of the bigger UK whisky retailers.  It's labelled as "95 proof" based on the [British system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_proof#History), meaning roughly it's 7/4 * ABV, where 70 proof is 40% ABV, and 175 proof is 100% ethanol.  They note that this is natural colour, but not cask-strength.

The bottle notes read:

> Sweet aromas of freshly baked apple pie.
> 
> Creme caramel and vanilla. smooth palate
>
> with hints of melted toffee and icing-topped
>
> gingerbread.  Deliciously light finish of ginger
>
> and Christmas cake.

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** apple fritter, caramel, green apple skin, raisins, cream, and orange zest 
* **Taste:** sherry forward, a little bit of milk chocolate, tannins, ginger snaps, and spice
* **Finish:** medium; quite a bit of spice, a little oakiness

This is a nicely vatted, slightly uncharacteristic Glenfarclas.  It's a bit hot in places, and I don't get enough deep, rich complexity to rank it more highly.  Still, avoiding some of the fickle downsides of the 105 is to be praised!

If you're interested in this bottle, it is still available from [The Whisky Exchange](https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/p/66516/glenfarclas-15-year-old-95-proof-exclusive-to-the-whisky-exchange).

**Rating: 5/10**
