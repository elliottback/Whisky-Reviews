**Johnnie Walker Blue Label / 43% / $90**

*Tasted neat*

This is a 1990s bottle of JWB, number N32353 that I picked up secondhand in Japan.  It was all in original packaging including the weird pewter pull-tab and rotting cork.  I had to strain it!

* **Color:** e150a
* **Nose:** it's all green apples on the nose, with a bit of toluene
* **Taste:** stale salt crackers, warm bread, apples and peaches, some oak and leather
* **Finish:** long, with some mixed berries

This is a pretty mediocre blend / blast from the past, and it really reinforces my opinion that Diageo will sell whatever the market can bear.

**Rating: 62/100**
