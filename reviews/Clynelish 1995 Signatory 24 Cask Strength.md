**Signatory Cask Strength Clynelish 1995 24 Year / 52.2% ABV**

*Tasted neat; with mineral water*

[This Clynelish](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/164378/clynelish-1995-sv) was loving distilled on 21/11/1995 and bottled 04/06/2020 from Refill Sherry Butt #11234.  This is natural colour, and cask strength; bottle #71 of 556 total.

In the past I have disliked some of the Signatory Cask Strength sherried Clynelishes, but it's all about the particular butt when it comes to the single-cask game, and so this one has turned out to be quite nice!

* **Color:** auburn (1.5)
* **Nose:** ethanol, sulphur, funky wax, cherries, and campfire smoke
* **Taste:** that Clynelish classic waxiness, soft sherry, raisins 
* **Finish:** long and oaky, dry sherry

This has quite the odd nose, but it doesn't corrupt the flavour profile, which is sweetly delicious and classic Clynelish. 

**Rating: 89/100**
