**Glen Rothes 1997 Signatory Velier Anniversary / 53.1% / $200**

*Tasted with a bit of filtered tap water*

[This](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/103497/glenrothes-1997-sv) is a special Glenrothes from Signatory, released in honour of the 70th anniversary of Italian importer Velier. It comes in an eye-numbing orange-red on green label, and was distilled in 02/06/1997, bottled on 17/04/2017 after sitting for 19 years in a refill sherry butt.

The outturn is 605 bottles at natural cask strenght, with natural colour, no filtration.

* **Color:** dark brown
* **Nose:** candle wax, SHERRY, ketchup, burnt rubber, and sulphur
* **Taste:** thick, butter and nuts off the top, dry sherry, a musty cigar room; snap peas
* **Finish:** medium, some sweetness that quickly tapers off, traces of orange peels

This is a pretty good, sulpury Glenrothes, juiced up at cask strength, but it's also got tons of unpalatable  off notes.  I'm glad to have tried it, but I like a more subtle/balanced style sherried whisky.

**Rating: 79/100**
