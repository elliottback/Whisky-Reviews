**Craigellachie 1995 22Yr - Old Malt Cask / 50% / $120**

*Tasted with a bit of filtered water*

[This](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/105186/craigellachie-1995-hl) is a 22 year old Craigellachie from Sherry Butt HL14460, distilled in September 1995 and bottled November 2017.  It has been watered down to the OMC staple 50%.

* **Color:** amontillado sherry (0.9)
* **Nose:** sulphur, rubber, bubble yum gum, mixed berry jam, a bit of mint 
* **Taste:** sprite, lemons, medium-dry sherry; oily oakiness 
* **Finish:** apple, butter, and vanilla 

This one's a bit all over the place for me; it's fruity and weird, but the rubbery nose kills it a bit for me.  Would I buy it again?  Maybe.  

**Rating: 73/100**
