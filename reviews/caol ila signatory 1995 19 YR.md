**Signatory Caol Ila 1995 19 YR / 46% / ~$120**

*Tasted with a bit of filtered tap water*

This is a non-chillfiltered, natural color Caol Ila, distilled 24/01/1995 and bottled 29/7/2014.  It is bottle 182 of 736, matured in hogsheads, casks 438 and 459.

* **Color:** straw
* **Nose:** peat smoke, iodine, pineapple, yeasty resting dough
* **Taste:** phenolic pineapple cake, smoked burnt bacon, oily kippers
* **Finish:** long, warm, ice cream

This is quite tasty, but feels younger than it is on the front.  After that it reflects more maturity.  I suspect the larger size of the hogshead leave less liquid to wood interaction, which is why it's so light colored after 19 years.  But it's definitely a solid Caol Ila, with all the usual characteristics, although I prefer Signatory's CS line of Caol Ila to this one.

**Rating: 86/100**
