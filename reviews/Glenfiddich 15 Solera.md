**Glenfiddich 15 Solera / 40% ABV / $16.44**

*Tasted neat*

From the back of the bottle, it explains what this "solera" thing is about:

> After 15 years, whisky matured in sherry, bourbon and new oak, is married in our unique, handcrafted Oregon pine Solera vat.  Our Solera vat is a large pine tun which is always kept at least half-full.

* **Color:** dark with a reddish hue
* **Nose:** sugar, chlorine, bark, quite floral
* **Taste:** bubblegum, smores, cedarwood
* **Finish:** solid leather and a bit of smoke, a great buttery texture

This is one of the best Glenfiddichs out there--and if you can get the 15yr old or higher at a better ABV (say a travel Distiller's Edition) go for it.  Absolutely fab.
