**Midleton Gold Spot 9 Year Old / 51.4% ABV**

*Tasted neat*

Done up for the 135th Anniversary of the Mitchell family's bonded whisky business, [Midleton Gold Spot](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/212631/gold-spot-09-year-old) is bottled at a higher 51.4% ABV and is non-chill-filtered.  It features a sumptuous 9 years age statement, and the cask mix is more diverse, with Bourbon Barrels, Sherry Butts, Bordeaux Wine Casks and Port Pipes used.  This is a limited edition of 3,800 bottles.

The website notes this is the first Spot to feature port-maturation:

> Gold Spot is the first member of the Spot family to contain a Port matured element. However it’s not Mitchell & Son’s first foray into this famous fortified wine from the Douro valley, up until the 1960’s the family bottled their own Vintage Port.

* **Color:** auburn (1.5)
* **Nose:** forest mulch, apple fritters, shoe-black, leather and oak; fresh berries
* **Taste:** wow! extremely fruity, strawberry and crisp pear; almonds, oily patisserie, and oak 
* **Finish:** medium-bodied with honey, brioche, and ending on beef jerky

Compared to the green spot (bordeaux finish), the nose is much more delicate, the body fruitier and more integrated.  This is a very nice vatting of casks, and I wouldn't be surprised if they used marrying casks to create it, maybe those french oak wine casks.  The higher ABV is a huge blessing here, it helps enormously with the mouth-feel.

One down-note is that this a 2022 bottle, but the cork has some adhesion problems.  Oh well, it happens.
