**Aberlour 18 / 43% ABV **

*Tasted neat, while watching HIMYM*

I received this as a gift, and while it's not as much of a banger as Abunadh, it's quite nice!

* **Color:** golden-brown
* **Nose:** alcohol, cream, sandalwood, fresh-cut grass
* **Taste:** oaky, vanilla, well-rounded cake
* **Finish:** delicious, long sweet coffee

I prefer the 12 NCF and Abunadh, but the 18 is a nice late-night dram.  It's warm, darker than a Macallan, less sherried and more toasted oak, but with sharper edges and hints of new oak.

**Rating: 84/100**
