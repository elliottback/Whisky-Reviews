**Amrut Peated Cask Strength / 62.8% ABV / 70cl**

*Tasted with a nip of bottled water*

An oak-aged, Indian, cask-strength, peated scotch?  Amazing.  This is the '09 limited edition, bottle 1803 of 3,000.  NCF, and natural colouring.

* **Color:** gold, almost auburn
* **Nose:** floral, with pears, peat and iodine
* **Taste:** thick, vanilla and spice, pumpkin, peat smoke
* **Finish:** short, but toffee with salty nuts

I'm fond of this--it's oxidized a bit of peat away since I've had it open too long, but it's a fantastically mellow pated world whisky.  It's the perfect stately counterpart to the young peated Hakushu.

**Rating: 83/100**
