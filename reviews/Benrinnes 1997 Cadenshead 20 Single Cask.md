**Cadenhead Single Cask Benrinnes 20 / 57.4% ABV / $150**

*Tasted with a drop of filtered tap water*

[This](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/137725/benrinnes-1997-ca) is a probably natural colour, NCF single cask from Cadenhead, matured in oak (ex-Bourbon from the taste) for 20 years.

* **Color:** straw
* **Nose:** very light springy rain and grass; forest, some apple and lemon
* **Taste:** creamy cheesecake, effervescent fruit salad; tart lemon zest
* **Finish:** light bodied but long, some lingering sweetness

This is a great, light, and not particularly complex dram.  It reminds me very much of Longmorn in style--I think I prefer the Benrinnes in Sherry.

**Rating: 75/100**
