**Bunnahabhain Eirigh Na Greine / 46.3% / Â£60**

*Tasted neat*

[This no-age-statement Bunnahabhain](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/56836/bunnahabhain-eirigh-na-greine#whisky-note-holder) for the travel-retail market was exclusively matured in Italian and French red wine casks. The marketing label notes that Eirigh Na Greine means "Morning Sky" in Scots Gaelic and promises a "rich, fruity malt with lots of sweet spice."

* **Color:** russet (1.3)
* **Nose:** pine-sol, iodine, some peat, juicy-fruit candy, butterscotch, and raisins
* **Taste:** thin and a bit hot, merlot, icing sugar, spiced wine, graham crackers
* **Finish:** short; molasses and honey

I'm not a fan of this treacly, over-sweet Bunnahabhain, there's not a lot of complexity beyond the sweet wineyness of it; it would have been better, I think, as a long finish after a reasonable period of initial aging in ex-bourbon casks.  The distillery characteristic is completely obliterated!

**Rating: 3/10**
