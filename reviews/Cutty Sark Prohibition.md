**Cutty Sark Prohibition / 50% ABV / $30**

*Tasted neat*

A grain and malt blend aged in American oak, the Prohibition appears to be a special higher-strength edition with no other particular qualities.  The marketing says it is a tribute to the real McCoy, a pirate who smuggled Cutty Sark into America during the prohibition.

* **Color:** perfect e150a (but non-chill-filtered!)
* **Nose:** rubbing alcohol, cracked pepper, cheese, malted barley
* **Taste:** salty lemons, light smoke, crackers, vomit
* **Finish:** hot, quick, sweet, creamy

It's a bit nauseating, but not a bad effort.  I appreciate the extra attention to make it closer to cask strength (although given the age, maybe it should be 65% firewater) and NCF.

If you are going to willing drink cutty sark, I'd advise you to elect the extra $5/10 to get this one!
