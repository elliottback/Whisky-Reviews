**Benriach 1997 TWA 23 Year Old / 50.7% ABV**

*Tasted neat*

[This Benriach](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/174087/benriach-1997-twa) was distilled in 1997 and bottled 202 from an ex-sherry butt for The Whisky Agency.  The yield is just 427 bottles of 23 year-old whisky.  It should be cask strength and non-chill filtered. 

* **Color:** russet (1.3)
* **Nose:** dry sherry, bandaids/rubber, candied apple, welch's grape juice, and leather
* **Taste:** dried figs, very soft, sweet sherry; fruit salad, bbq pork, pineapple, and watermelon
* **Finish:** medium, quite dry, all sherry

This is more-or-less a run-of-the-mill ex-sherry Benriach, it comes across a bit sulphured and thin.  

**Rating: 82/100**
