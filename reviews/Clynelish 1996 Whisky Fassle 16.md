**Clynelish 1996 Whisky Fässle 16 Year / 53.3%**

*Tasted with a bit of bottled water*

[This Clynelish](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/42795/clynelish-1996-w-f) was distilled in 1996 and bottled in 2013 from a Sherry Cask.  It's natural color and not filtered, and a bit of a special release for a German whisky club, Whisky Fässle.

* **Color:** auburn (1.5)
* **Nose:** roasted pears, brandy, subtle leather and lilacs
* **Taste:** sweet sherry, candle wax, raspberry
* **Finish:** long and soft, gentle sweetness

Finally!!  I've found a sherry-cask Clynelish that's great.  I quite love Clynelish in bourbon, but often I've been overwhelmed by refill-sherry cask Clynelish, and I think it needs a more active/sherried cask and perhaps less time in the barrel.

**Rating: 92/100**
