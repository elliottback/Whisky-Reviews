**Ardbeg Day - Release the Peat! / 56.7% ABV / $85**

*tasted neat, w/filtered water*

This was released on June 2nd, 2012 to celebrate and promote Ardbeg!  They'll be doing it again next year, and if you don't feel like buying a bottle, you can go [like them on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Ardbeg) and attend a free Ardbeg party near you:

> It was an Olympic effort from all concerned. All over the globe and on Islay, people ran, swam, jumped and drank Ardbeg. Mostly drank Ardbeg. And now we�ve got our breath back, we�d like to thank all those near and far that made the inaugural Ardbeg Day such a monumental event. And don�t forget, we�ll be doing it all again next year so please save the date � Saturday 1st June 2013

Since they ran 12,000 bottles, you should be able to find it.  It's a vatting of two different styles of Ardbeg thrown together in ex-sherry casks for the final 6 months.

* **Color:** burnished gold
* **Nose:** cream, mint, seawater, slight peat, heather
* **Taste:** cinnamon, vanilla, islay hellstone and brimfire, barbeque, sherry
* **Finish:** amazing warmth, honey
