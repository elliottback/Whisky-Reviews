**Imperial 1996 Single Cask Nation 24 Year Old / 56.4%**

*Tasted neat*

This is the first Imperial in the late 1996 vintage I have reviewed, a [24 year old](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/169151/imperial-1996-jwc) from the Jewish Whisky Company / Single Cask Nation.  One of just 186 bottles, it was distilled april 1996 and laid to rest in second-fill bourbon barrel #3420 before being bottled in september 2020.

The bottle notes read:

    Candy sweetness and herbaceous minerality on the nose and 
    palate give way to fresh citrus and building oak spice 
    before finishing on honeyed, peppery notes.

Note that now-mothballed Imperial was last active in 1998, and that the last few years of production did not have a good reputation for excellence.  Today, new distillery Dalmunach has been built on the Imperial site.

* **Color:** russet (1.3)
* **Nose:** vanilla, cream, lemon cake, and rosewater 
* **Taste:** rich custard, chalky oak, crème brûlée, lime sorbet; grassy notes
* **Finish:** medium length, full-bodied honey drizzled over vanilla ice cream

The nose starts off closed, and unpromising but opens up with some time in the glass.  From the get-go, the flavour is rich and as good an Imperial as I can say I've ever had the pleasure to enjoy.

**Rating: 93/100**
