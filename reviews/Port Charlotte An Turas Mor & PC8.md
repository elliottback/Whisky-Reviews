**Port Charlotte An Turas Mor / 46% ABV / $60**

*tasted neat, w/bottled water*

Finally!  A scotch that labels as both E150 free and NCF!  

*An Turas Mor* means "The Great Journey", a whisky that Jim McEwan finally believes is good enough for the [resurrected Port Charlotte distillery](http://bit.ly/QE1nx4) to showcase.  Apparently, it's a 2010 multi-vintage vatting **peated to 40ppm** (yum!) and aged in American Oak.  No age statement.

* **Color:** pale layers of rippling sandstone
* **Nose:** rotting peaches and apples past their time, hay and summer sea spray.  Rotting kelp.
* **Taste:** honeysuckle-mustard barbeque glaze, peppered jerky, earthy peat
* **Finish:** oaky warmth and sweetness, longer with a touch of water

I really like An Turas Mor!  It's peaty, floral, with the charred-cask BBQ characteristics we love in Ardbeg Alligator, but less in your face and balanced with perfect sweet notes.  My only complaint might be that it's only 46%--which is **amazingly better than 43% or 40%**--or that there's no notes on what the vattings were that went into making it.  It tastes like a young Kilchoman with the edges rounded off, and I hope Bruichladdich keeps making more of it.  The only thing I can say about this eminently drinkable malt is that it's not nearly as complex as its older, stronger cousins.

**Rating: 87/100**

**Port Charlotte PC8 "Ar Duthchas" / 60.5% ABV**

*tasted neat, w/bottled water*

Massive.  Just *look* at that ABV!  I like Cask Strength and I canna lie...

* **Color:** Slightly darker than An Turas Mor, almost a bit reddish
* **Nose:** cabernet wine, truffles, heavy vanilla
* **Taste:** boom! peatshot; tramping through muddy shore, bits of dried fruit along the way, forlorn figs, to arrive at a beach bonfire
* **Finish:** long and almost sherried; malty

This is the older brother, and 8 year old Port Charlotte Expression from Bruichladdich and it's a great sign of what's to come.  It's bottled at Cask Strength, a blistering ~61% ABV that is absolutely wonderful.  You're allowed to add some water to this one; it brings out heather in the nose, leather on the tongue. and more oak/smoke on the finish

I highly recommend this--and the other numbered PC releases, as they are great.

**Rating: 94/100**
