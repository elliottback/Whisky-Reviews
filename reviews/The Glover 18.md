**The Glover 18  / 49.2% / $150**

*Tasted with a bit of filtered tap water*

There is some history of [this Adelphi line here](https://malt-review.com/2016/08/25/the-glover-18/); the backstory is they got ahold of a couple Hanyu casks and decided to make a blend.  The 22 Yr version of this blend is ~40% Hanyu (a single ex-Sherry hogshead!), but here we have one of 1406 bottles, of which 10% is Hanyu, and the rest a vatting of Longmorn and Glen Garioch.

By the way, if you really want the 22 year which is like half Hanyu, it's still available for about $1k in Japan...

* **Color:** not sure if natural or not
* **Nose:** bourbon, pine, lemons and leather; it doesn't give much up on the nose
* **Taste:** delightfully rich, plummy, an oily texture, with charcoal and grassy notes
* **Finish:** long, sweet finish; butyric acid

I like the idea of ~~wasting~~ blending a Hanyu cask with Scotch, especially Longmorn.  It creates something unique and limited, and consumers are willing to pay a bit more to see what on earth those ~~nutheads~~ geniuses have made.  A bit pricier than I like, but a solid blend.

**Rating: 90/100**
