**Lagavulin 8 / 48% / ~$90**

*Tasted with a bit of filtered Tokyo tap water*

A young bottled widely-available "limited" release celebrating the 200th anniversary of Lagavulin.  It's so available it's not even moving off the shelves in Tokyo...

* **Color:** new make with a hint of gold, almost clear
* **Nose:** baijiu, salty nori, banana cake, yeast
* **Taste:** thick, oily pineapple, peaty, cream and vanilla, white pepper
* **Finish:** medium, estery and sweet

For such a young whisky with a nose that I do not like at all--it feels very young and unrefined--the taste is quite good.  I do prefer the Lagavulin 12 to the 16, and both the 8.

**Rating: 87/100**
