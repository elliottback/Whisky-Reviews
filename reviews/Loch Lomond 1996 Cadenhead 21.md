**Loch Lomond 1996 Cadenhead 21 / 51.5%**

*Tasted neat and with a bit of bottled water*

Loch Lomond is an "independent" conglomerate of Loch Lomond, Glen Scotia, and Littlemill, recently snapped up by an Asian investment fund.  [This Loch Lomond](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/128210/loch-lomond-1996-ca) is one of the now-discontinued Cadenhead Small Batch release, a vatting of 2 ex-bourbon barrels.

Distilled in 1996, and bottled 2018, we have an impressive 450 bottles at cask strength.

* **Color:** deep gold (0.8)
* **Nose:** honey, black pepper, a little peat, pear jam, vanilla; heather
* **Taste:** shortbread, tropical fruits, oily pineapple; asian white pear
* **Finish:** long and custardy, a hint of oakiness

Inchmurrin this is (for a little blog on the various Loch Lomond styles on offer, [check this out](https://blog.thewhiskyexchange.com/2017/07/loch-lomond-thirteen-styles-of-whisky-one-distillery/)).  It's quite a refreshing, fruity, and light style of whisky, with the perfect hint of peat.  This at cask strength is gorgeous!

**Rating: 89/100**
