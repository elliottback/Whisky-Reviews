**Benriach 1994 Sauternes Finish 16 Year Old / 57.4% ABV**

*Tasted neat*

[This Benriach](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/28943/benriach-1994) for the Taiwan market was distilled in 1994 and bottled in March, 2011 after spending 16 years in a Hogshead with a Sauternes Finish of unknown quality and length.  This is bottle #16 of 270, from cask 4794.

The label notes read:

    Fantastic dessert-like qualities.  Late harvest grapes and sweet sultanas bound with fine American oak characteristics.

* **Color:** auburn (1.5)
* **Nose:** solvent, gingerbread, cornmeal biscuits, milk chocolate and peaches
* **Taste:** minerally white wine grapes, some vanilla, gazpacho, chewy oak, some tannins
* **Finish:** long, nail polish, cinnamon, and gummy worms

This one is a miss for me, I am not a big fan of candy--bubble gum, gummies--notes in whisky, and this one has a few of those along with some hotness I'd hope not to see in a 16 year old.  I'm guessing it was some kind of rejuvenated refilled hogshead before they attempted a save with the Sauternes finish.

**Rating: 3/10**
