**Glenfarclas 40 yr / 46% / $399**

*Tasted neat*

### Am I doing this right?!  AM I TOO LATE?????^1

* **Color:** Spanish cedar stained with fresh blood
* **Nose:** chocolate cake, cuban cigars, sherry, jam, alcohol fumes^2
* **Taste:** ambrosial myrhh, figgy syrups, bitters, rich oily texture, devil's food cake, vanillins
* **Finish:** spices (nutmeg, cinnamon), leather, and coffee linger in my throat for minutes.  I think this is the longest finish ever, in my limited experience.

So this amazing malt was distilled in the late 60s/early 70s, and it really highlights how far scotch has fallen since then.  I've had the pleasure of tasting '60s Aberlour 12, and it's nothing like it is now.  While most people will be gaping at the 40 years in the cask, what's more amazing is that this was from 40 years ago, before the scotch boom and bust, the recent quality degredation in the face of increasing demand, the outstripping of natural resources.

Or maybe Scotland was just nastier then, and all of that made it into the bottle.  I don't care, this fucking rocks.

**Rating: 98/100**

I can't believe this is 46% after 40 years!
