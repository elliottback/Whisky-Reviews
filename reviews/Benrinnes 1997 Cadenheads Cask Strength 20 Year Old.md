**Benrinnes 1997 Cadenhead's Cask Strength 20 Year Old / 54.0% / ~$125**

*Tasted neat, then with a bit of bottled water*

[This Benrinnes](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/108825/benrinnes-1997-ca) is *not* a single cask, but rather a small-batch vatting of three bourbon barrels to yield just 408 bottles at 54%.  Distilled in 1997 and bottled in 2017 for 20 years of age, the bottle's tasting notes promise:

    Nose: Kiwi fruits, icing sugar and brazil nuts.
    Palate: slight earth and dunnage notes, dark chocolate and green apples
    Finish: Cajun spice, paprika and a fruitiness with pears and more apples 

*Minor complaint: these square bottles are hard to get the last drop out!*

* **Color:** old gold (0.65)
* **Nose:** cream custard, nail polish acetone, sliced apples; with water, some whole-grain bread and honeysuckle 
* **Taste:** oak, tropical fruits, malty pineapple; vanilla lime sorbet
* **Finish:** cocoa and butterscotch; with water, cardboard and  caramel

Doing three barrels into a small batch run is a great way to ensure that you have a more consistent but still unique expression of Benrinnes to sell, and this one absolutely hits the marks.  This bottle did not last me long... 

**Rating: 87/100**
