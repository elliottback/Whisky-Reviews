**Old Pulteney / 12 Yr / 43% ABV**

*Tasted neat*

As the entry level malt in Old Pulteney's Wickian quiver, I strongly suspect it is both chill-filtered and coloured with e150 caramel colour.  It's been aged in "air dried" ex-bourbon casks.

* **Color:** boring e150a to a yellowy mess
* **Nose:** sea smoke, caramel, salt toffee, plastic-roasted nuts
* **Taste:** beer nuts, buttered popcorn, vanilla, cake
* **Finish:** sweet, short, with high notes of torched plastic and factory-fresh rubber

I'm just not feeling OP12; it lacks sufficient complexity or lightness.  From the marketing you'd expect a nimble spirit like Talisker or Scapa's little catamarans but instead Old Pulteney has delivered a Maersk Triple E: slow, heavy, and dull.

**Rating: 68/100**
