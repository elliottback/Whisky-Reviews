**Talisker 30 / 45.8% / $372.71**

*Tasted neat*

I got started into scotch when I first tasted the amazing dram Talisker 10, and since then my favourites in this line are the distiller's edition and one, off-change late 60s Talisker I once had the pleasure to try at a tasting.

* **Color:** amber
* **Nose:** raspberries, salt spray, hazelnut, toasted marshmellow, peat, plasticky meat, furry oak planks
* **Taste:** fruit, cream, vanillins, syopy mouthfeel, sourdough bread
* **Finish:** extremely attenuated, some oak, glazed red vines

This is an interesting example--it's *smooth* using the layman's lexigraphy--rounded off, and thin.  It's what happens to a good Islay when you lock it away too long and don't drink it.  Talisker just doesn't have enough body to last the years.  Even Caol Ila is tired when it hits 30.

Still, there's nothing offensive here.  It's relaxing, warm; enveloping.  The finish is over too quickly; it dies in your mouth.  You don't feel much.

**Rating: 83/100**
