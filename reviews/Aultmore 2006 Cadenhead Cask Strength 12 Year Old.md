**Aultmore-Glenlivet 2006 Cadenhead Cask Strength 12 Year Old / 57.4%**

*Tasted neat*

While Cadenhead's is not making any more of these, I have some Small Batch / Cask Strength editions still gathering dust, among them [this 12 year old Aultmore](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/127958/aultmore-2006-ca), which is a vatting of four bourbon hogsheads, and bottled at cask strength for 1044 bottles.  

Their tasting notes read:

> Nose: Creamy, fresh spearmint and slight moss.
> 
> Palate: Watermelon, pineapple juice and clotted cream.
> 
> Finish: Lemon and lime, orange bitters and grated nutmeg

* **Color:** 0.9 (amontillado sherry)
* **Nose:** acetone, grass, mint, whipped cream; tar
* **Taste:** oily, lots of tropical fruits, a little bit of vanilla ice cream, minerality, and oak
* **Finish:** long but subtle; canned fruit cocktail salad

I cannot remember how much I paid for this, but it would have been in the Â¥10,000 ($67 USD now, $80 in more normal times) range, and probably included as padding in a bundle.

This is a lovely, light, fruity summer dram -- it is really too bad that Cadenhead has killed this lineup.

**Rating: 7/10**
