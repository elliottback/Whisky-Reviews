This distillery is mainly a workhorse for Diageo's J&B, so the release was an unusual one.  It's perfectly pleasant, albeit worksmanlike, done in probably refill-bourbon barrels, with maybe the odd 4th fill ex-sherry in there.

To be honest, it's a bit tired and closed; I don't think this really highlights what Auchroisk can do.  

Diageo carefully selected some casks for this limited edition, and they produce a passable spirit, but there's no excitement.  This is a staid "whisky" whisky, punching out just enough complexity to enjoy a part in the 2010 Diageo Special Releases, but not anything interesting enough to make me want to buy it again.
