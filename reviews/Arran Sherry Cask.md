**Arran Sherry Cask "The Bodega" / 55.8% ABV / Â¥9,500 ($67)**

*Tasted neat*

From Lochranza comes [the Arran Sherry Cask](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/138742/arran-sherry-cask), a whisky-lovers dram boasting natural cask strength, natural colour, and non-chill filtering from a 250L sherry hogshead.  The front label also features braille, which is awesome and something I do not see on most bottles.

The blurb claims:

> -- Complex and luxurious. Notes of dark chocolate and ginger. Hints of spice, ripe figs and sweet cherries.

* **Color:** burnt umber (1.7) -- quite dark
* **Nose:** turpentine, chocolate, stewed plums, honeycrisp apple, salt spray, and oloroso sherry 
* **Taste:** honey, sherry, a very juicy fruitiness, some butter, tobacco smoke, and lemon zest
* **Finish:** quite long and sweet, with berry jam

I was somewhat skeptical when I bought this, only to find the bottle disappeared quite quickly before my eyes.  It's eminently drinkable, a very well-produced and integrated sherry bomb.  While I did not get the cherry notes the label promised, it's packed full of flavour that develops in the glass over time.

Considering the price, this is a good, affordable new mainstay to add your sherry go-to list.

**Rating: 6/10**
