**Clynelish 2011 Single Cask Nation 9 Year Old / 60.1%**

*Tasted neat, then with a drop of bottled water*

From the [Jewish Whisky Company's Single Cask Nation label](https://singlecasknation.com/) comes [a 9-year old Clynelish](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/168998/clynelish-2011-jwc) distilled in May 2011, matured in 2nd fill bourbon barrel #800315, and finally bottled in October 2020.  Just one of 244 bottles.

The label notes "vibrant and sweet with a fruity thread that runs through the entire experience.  The oak and pepper are perfect foils, though, able to keep the sweetness at bay while framing the fruitiness."

This was distilled before [Clynelish modernized in 2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/e0krq0/what_makes_clynelish_so_waxy_a_detailed_look_at/) so it should still be nice and waxy.  This is single cask / cask strength, and though not stated, probably also NCF and natural colour.

* **Color:** amber (0.7)
* **Nose:** lemonade, candlewax, meringue pie, some oak, tropical fruits, and sugar
* **Taste:** lemon-pepper chicken, sandalwood, more wax and some minerality 
* **Finish:** long, hong-kong style pastry tarts (not the egg ones, but the fruit ones!) and a cloying sweetness

This is a very young Clynelish, so it's distillate forward, especially after resting in a refill bourbon barrel.  It's a little special; I enjoyed it, and it's got the Clynelish character, but these super-young Clynelishes are not my favourite, I think it's a distillery that does a little better with more time in oak.

**Rating: 6/10**
