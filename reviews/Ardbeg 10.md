**Ardbeg 10 / 46% / $60**

*Tasted neat*

I realized that I've never review this dram, and so for our [37^th community review](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/2o1n65/community_review_37_ardbeg_10/), I'm going to take a stab.

* **Color:** senescent blonde 
* **Nose:** pineapple, peat, **I DON'T GIVE A FUCK**, salty lemons, unripe citrus; the ketonic flames of hell
* **Taste:** sleet, **WHOAH^HAO^OOO^H^H**, bananas, mildew, lighter fluid, herring, toluene
* **Finish:** depth here--a tingling, oily coating on the tongue, creamy afternotes, **AHHHHHH^HHHHHHHHH**, rice crackers

I enjoy this dram when I need a break from Uigeadail or more complicated fare.  It's crisp, refreshing; a breath of fresh aire.

**Rating: 89/100**
