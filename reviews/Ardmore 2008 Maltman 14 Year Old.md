**Ardmore 2008 Maltman 14 Year Old / 53.9% ABV**

*Tasted neat*

This Ardmore was distilled in July 2008 and laid to rest in refill Sherry butt #108431 for 14 years before being bottled in October 2022, yielding 408 bottles. This was yet another bottle I've acquired from mandatory bundling.  As expected, this is non-chill filtered, cask strength, and natural colour.  We do get some notes from The Maltman:

> The nose has some peaty aromas with hints of green tea and bonfire embers.
> 
> The palate is velvety in texture with some creamy peppercorn and nutty notes.
> 
> Let it breathe and some spicy dark chocolate and fresh pastry flavour come through.
> 
> The finish is warming with a little smoke and subtle marzipan.

What is "The Maltman"?  It's a spinoff brand created by one of the two *Hart Brothers*, Donald Hart and his son Andrew.

* **Color:** burnt umber (1.7)
* **Nose:** iodine and peat, moldy hay, oysters, brine, and coal tar
* **Taste:** rich & oily, with campfire smoke, barbeque, strawberry, pecan, ocean spray, some peat  
* **Finish:** long & sweet; hot-cocoa, smoke, and graham crackers 

Delightfully complex, the refill sherry doesn't completely extinguish the delicious Ardmore, and the marriage is a fiery but rich, layered combination of fruity peat and indolant sherry.
