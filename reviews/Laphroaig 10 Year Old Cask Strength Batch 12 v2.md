**Laphroaig 10 Year Old Cask Strength Batch 12 / 60.1%**

*Tasted neat*

[Batch 12 of the Laphroaig 10 year old Cask Strength](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/159190/laphroaig-cask-strength) was bottled on February 7th, 2020 after being aged for 10 years in ex-bourbon wood.  A pretty large vatting, we don't get to know how many bottles were released or anything more!  The back label reads:

> Emphatic, full bodied and utterly unforgettable.  10 Year Old Original Cask Strength Laphroaig is the authentic way to experience the rugged character of our uncompromising Scotch whisky.  It is an Islay single malt that is barrier-filtered only and bottled at natural cask strength.  This gives a depth of genuine tasting and texture normally associated with sampling a whisky at its source.

This is my second time around, I previously reviewed it [here](https://elliottback.medium.com/whisky-review-laphroaig-10-year-old-cask-strength-batch-12-a33a3fcf6388), but didn't feel like dropping it from the lineup so we'll have a second take today!

* **Color:** russet (1.3)
* **Nose:** tar, peat smoke, burned rubber, tarmac, iodine, black liquorish; phenolic
* **Taste:** big peaty BBQ smoke, roast smores, a touch of strawberry, burnt lemon, and thick, rich, oily bandaids
* **Finish:** long, the intensity fades to a soothing peat lozenge with caramel and vanilla

This still goes extremely hard, it's deliciously fantastic, and unbeattable for the price.

**Rating: 8/10**
