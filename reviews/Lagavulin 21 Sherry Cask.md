*Tasted neat*

This was distilled in 1991, bottled in 2012 for the second run of Diageo's sherried Lagavulin.  Only 2772 bottles were produced, from first-fill sherry casks.  Some people prefer the first edition, released in 2007, noting that the 2012 is cleaner and less sherried; others claim it's too sulphury.  It appears to be completely sold out in the US, so I'm glad I have another bottle.

* **Color:** ruby, fringes of red
* **Nose:** plastic, peat, watermelon, strawberries, alcohol
* **Taste:** rose-flavoured spring water, a bit of fruit; thin
* **Finish:** amazingly long, quite smokey

I added a little bit of water; it doesn't seem to be helping.

This is a fine spirit, but I think it's proof that adding sherry to everything doesn't always work.  Ardbeg's approach with Uigeadail of marrying sherry fill and young oak spirit together seems to produce a much richer experience.

Sessioning it produces a more enjoyable experience, it takes some time to open up and get used to.
