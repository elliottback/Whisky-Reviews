**Benrinnes 23 - Cadenhead Small Batch / 51.1% ABV / 4000 NTD (~$133)**

*Tasted neat / with a drop of mineral water*

I'm starting to get really fond of these square Cadenhead's Small Batch releases ever after I went to their tasting class at 2018's Whisky Fair Takao in Taiwan.

[This Benrinnes](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/127955/benrinnes-1995-ca) was distilled 1995 and bottled 2019 after 23 years from 3 bourbon hogsheads, giving you 708 bottles.  I am not sure if this was Taiwan exclusive or not, but I bought 3 of them there, as the price was just too good to pass up.  Where can you get 23 year old cask strength juice for $133?

Tasting notes from the bottle read:

    Nose: vanilla pods, a hint of dunnage warehouse and fresh fruit salad
    Palate: Kiwi, candy floss and strawberry yoghurt
    Finish: Citrus and hop notes, lemon peel, and honeycomb

* **Color:** gold ingot
* **Nose:** lemon cake, petrichor, ethanol, some bananas
* **Taste:** citrus fruit tarts, sweet n' sour gummies, oreo cookies, and cut grass
* **Finish:** some of the oak comes through at the end, long, honeyed green tea and vanilla

This is a really nice dram, and Cadenhead are really putting out a fantastic product at the price point.  I would definitely buy this particular bottle again, and will continue buying Cadenhead's releases as I see them.

**Rating: 91/100**
