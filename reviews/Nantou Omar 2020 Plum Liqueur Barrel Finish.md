**Nantou Omar 2020 Plum Liqueur Barrel Finish / 52% ABV**

*Tasted neat*

Although Whiskybase is lagging behind in tracking all of these releases, they do have [this 2015 edition](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/75975/nantou-omar) of Taiwan Tobacco & Liquor Corp's *Nantou Distillery* bottle which is closest to the one I am reviewing today.

Nantou Omar offers a cask-strength single malt finished in a Plum Liqueur barrel.  The bottle date here is 2020.10.08 (F), and it is non-chill-filtered.

You can read a little bit more about [the Plum Liqueur Barrel Finish](http://www.omarwhisky.com.tw/en/product_info.aspx?id=43) on their official website ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225003355/http://www.omarwhisky.com.tw/en/product_info.aspx?id=43)).

* **Color:** auburn (1.5)
* **Nose:** Japanese umeshu, unripe/green plums, apricot, varnish, corn potage and molasses  
* **Taste:** fruit tarts drizzled with honey, roasted plums, some vanilla, a little oak; crisp apple, and a tart undertaste
* **Finish:** medium; quite sweet, the fruit give way to a sugar glaze and Christmas spice

A fine offering from the Kingdom of fruits, this is probably the *only* widely available plum-liqueur (aka Umeshu)-finished whisky in the world, and it's pretty fruity and delicious.  Keep in mind that you are not getting a classic ex-Bourbon/Sherry profile here by any means, but rather more of a dessert cordial.

**Rating: 6/10**
