**Deanston 2007 Signatory Cask Strength 13 Year / 63.9% / Â£94.37**

*Tasted neat, then with a drop of bottled water*

[This is my first Deanston](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/177900/deanston-2007-sv), and it's well dressed in a first-fill sherry but #900141, distilled on 14/06/2007 then bottled at 13 years on 13/01/2021.  This is bottle 607 of a massive yield of 613 cask-strength, 63.9% ABV monsters.

There are still bottles available for purchase at the time of writing, such as [1 at TWB](https://www.thewhiskybarrel.com/deanston-13-year-old-2007-signatory-cask-strength-900141).

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** palo cortado, raisins, vanilla ice cream with whipped cream, almonds; honey-baked ham, hibiscus
* **Taste:** vanilla cream puff butter pastry, mango, candied 7-dimensional papaya; waxy mead
* **Finish:** long and incredibly sweet; confectionary chocolate ganache

This is amazing.  I think this is full-term palo-cortado cask (and an excellent one) maturation.  This is not a regular ex-PX/Oloroso sherry finish, or even a nice full-term maturation.  Palo Cortado is fairly rare in the world of finishing Scotch; I've really only seen it rarely, but to great effect, in some Bunnahabhains.

**Rating: 96/100**
