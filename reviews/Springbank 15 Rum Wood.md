**Springbank 15 Rum Wood / 51% / $150**

*Tasted neat*

With runs of just 9000 bottles, [the Springbank 15 Rum Wood](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/138562/springbank-15-year-old), like most other Springbank, tends to sell out instantly.  This was distilled in December 2003, and bottled in August 2019 from first-fill rum barrels.  It also has an OB back label *printed* in Japanese, which is somewhat unusual, and means they allocated quite a good number of these to the Japan market.

* **Color:** amber (0.7)
* **Nose:** sweet honey, guava, pineapple, peat, and ocean spray 
* **Taste:** funky SB dunnage warehouse, earthy peat, tropical fruit salad
* **Finish:** honey drizzled over rich cheese, long

I love the higher ABV of this, 51% is huge compared to 46%!  This is delicious, but the Springbank hype train is pretty strong so be prepared to pay some insane markup to get your hands on a bottle.

**Rating: 90/100**
