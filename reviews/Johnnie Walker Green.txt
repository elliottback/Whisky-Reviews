**Johnnie Walker Green / 43% / 1L for ~$70**

*Tasted neato*

Allegedly 40% Talisker, 40% Caol Ila, mostly Linkwood and Cragganmore in the remaining, this obviously coloured, chill filtered, Diageo (ALL PRAISE THE GODS!!!!) swill has never actually be reviewed by me here.  How can that be!?  I am moving to rectify this.

Oh, and this lovely 1L bottle boasts a 15 year age statement, which is the first point in its favour!

* **Color:** e150a
* **Nose:** honeysuckle, campfire, liquorice, acetone
* **Taste:** round oakiness, a bit of seaweed, cream, phenol, salt
* **Finish:** warm, medium in length, not particularly noteworthy

This is not worth drinking neat.  Put it in ice, after you've had a few drams, and enjoy the inoffensive, slightly peaty, Johnnie Walker blend.

**Rating: 59/100**
