**Thompson Brothers Blended Malt SRV5 Batch 1 / 48.5%**

*Tasted neat*

[Thompson Brothers Blended Malt SRV5 Batch 1](https://www.thompsonbrosdistillers.com/srv5/) is a blended malt made by vatting together 8 year old whiskies in a large, charred oak vat, allowing them to marry, diluting this to 48.5%, and then bottling 2/3 of it from the solera, the rest of which proceeds on to the next batch.  It is non-chill filtered.

The label artwork is from [Yu Kurahashi of Bar Tre, Hiroshima Japan](https://www.kkhiroshima.com/), and the name of this blend comes from Station Road 5 where the vatting solera is located.

* **Color:** deep gold (0.8)
* **Nose:** bananas, lime, tropical fruits, dunnage warehouse, and pudding
* **Taste:** light; lemon-lime, guava, white chocolate, bananas, and butter 
* **Finish:** medium, a little frosting sugar, meringue pie

This was a surprisingly fruity, tasty drinker of a blend.  It's got whisky chops (solera, NCF, age statement, slightly beefed up ABV) that appeal to single malt specification fans.  And the price, *chef's kiss*.  This has to absolutely dominate the landscape of £30/bottle whisky.

You can buy this today starting at about £30 GBP (ex-VAT) from [the Thompson Brother's webstore](https://www.thompsonbrosdistillers.com/product/srv5/) or at whisky specialists near you.

**Rating: 6/10**
