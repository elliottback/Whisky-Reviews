**Ardmore 2009 Watt Whisky 11 Year Old / 52% ABV**

*Tasted neat*

Bottled for the Campbeltown Whisky Company / Watt Whisky's "The Electric Coo Series", [this Ardmore](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/196563/ardmore-2009-cwcl) was distilled in December 2009 and laid to rest in a single ex-bourbon barrel.  Probably because of the peat here, the front label features a bovine skeleton and the subtitle "an adventure 10,500 years in the making".

The back has a simulated review discussion between Brain & Pinky:

> BRAIN'S CHOICE:
> 
> Ah, the joy that is Ardmore Scotch Whisky. Delightful suggestions of peat with Autumnal heather and Highland dew drops cascading down the soft green banks of the burn... Right, stop that. Started off as a nice little review and then got silly. This one is all about the distillery; the wood is tired and needs a holiday so we're setting it free back into the wild (or more likely to be made into  garden furniture).
> 
> PINKY'S REBUTTAL:
> 
> Classic, clean Highland spirit with loads of distillery character shining through..? What's going on here then? Where's the mucking about with odes of oak influence, finishing, or rather 'resting here, there and everywhere until no trace of any distillery can be detected by human nose.  If we did such a thing (or if it even existed), this would be a 'serious' dram, Pinky & Brain being serious... begins looking in the book of Revelations
> 
> Een moaie koe

That last is Dutch for "A beautiful cow".

* **Color:** yellow gold (0.5)
* **Nose:** squeezed lemons, clean peat smoke, petrichor, a little honey, and heather
* **Taste:** richly oily and thick; lemon meringue, green grapeskin, some melon, and graham crackers
* **Finish:** warming and long, mostly icing sugar, the slightest hint of oakiness, and citrus

This is really an excellent, spirit-forward Ardmore with absolutely nothing to detract from the clean, elegant lines of the spirit.

**Rating: 7/10**
