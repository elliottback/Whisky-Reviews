**Sullivan's Cove Double Cask 9 / 45% / $185**

*Tasted neat*

This is a Tasmanian whisky which blew up after their French Oak won medals and has become ridiculously expensive.  It is non-chill filtered, aged in American and French Oak, and aged 11 years.  According to the label it Double Cask N9 #DC098, Bottle 772 of 1,332 and mixed from 5 barrels (GG0364, TD00050, TD0135, TD0170, TD0225).

Sullivan's Cove actually sells and ships abroad directly from the distillery now, which is pretty cool; their customer support staff is also quite nice--apparently I was the first to order to Japan and they had to adjust some invoicing for import duties.  It works out a bit cheaper than buying retail here--especially when AUD drops against JPY.

* **Color:** dirty blonde
* **Nose:** creamy cake, lemonade, unlit tobacco, and boiled pears
* **Taste:** bright and sparkling cut grass, malty chocolate balls, banana bread on the edge
* **Finish:** long, rich and oily, like biting into just the right layer of Tiramisu

I really like it!  I wish it were more around the $100 range, but it's a completely unique whisky product, so I will probably buy some bottle from the distillery every so often.

**Rating: 86/100**
