**Port Charlotte Islay Barley / 50% ABV**

*Tasted with a bit of filtered tap water*

This is made from Islay local barley peated to 40PPM, non-chill-filtered or coloured.  It's a NAS, but they distilled it in Dec 2008 and released in 2015, so it's not more than 6 years old.

* **Color:** bottle blonde
* **Nose:** machine shop, salty peat, smoked salmon, turpentine
* **Taste:** very light, clean; some creamy peatiness, damp vegetation, vanilla
* **Finish:** short and dry

I am not particularly impressed with this offering; although it's OK it seems to lack the vivacity and mouthfeel you expect from Bruichladdich's Port Charlottes.

**Rating: 71/100**

**Port Charlotte 8 Ar Dùthchas / 60.5% ABV**

*Tasted with a bit of filtered tap water*

This is the fourth Port Charlotte regular release, a lovely eight year old bottled at cask strength.   Like the previous, NCF, NC, matured in American Oak, and peated to 40 ppm.

* **Color:** golden
* **Nose:** alcohol, peat smoke, leather, pears
* **Taste:** very thick, oily mouthfeel, huge burst of peat, strawberries
* **Finish:** long, angel food cake and smores

This is, I think, the quintessential Port Charlotte bottling, and it's fantastic--a real firecracker!

**Rating: 91/100**

**Port Charlotte 12 / 58.7%**

*Tasted with a bit of filtered tap water*

This is the new 12 year old "standard range" which I am excited about, as it should mean cheap, plentiful Port Charlotte for all to enjoy!

* **Color:** muddy, brown gold
* **Nose:** light peat, alcohol, creme brulee
* **Taste:** rough but smokey, sweet grapes, quite oaky, oily and thick, leather
* **Finish:** long, with ice cream, burnt sugar, peat

I quite like it!  Not quite as much as the PC8, which is my personal fav, but it's nice and I will be buying more bottles :D

**Rating: 90/100**
