**Glenfiddich 15 Distillery Edition / 51% ABV / NCF**

*tasted neat, then with bottled water*

Quick review time for this amazingly delicious bottle of Glenfiddich bought on our way back to the states in the Schiphol airport duty free in Amsterdam!

* **Color:** brunette
* **Nose:** cream and honey, clover
* **Taste:** thick oaky vanilla, spice, syrup
* **Finish:** medium-long lasting, with hints of sherry, pepper

If you have a chance to pick up a bottle, do!  They are nice 1L bottles of what is essentially the Glenfiddich 15 but at near-cask strength.  The extra power turns this staple into a great, muscular dessert.

**Rating: 85/100**
