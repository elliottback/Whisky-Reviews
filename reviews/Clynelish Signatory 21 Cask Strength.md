**Signatory Cask Strength Clynelish 1995 21 YR / 55.5% ABV/ $150**

*Tasted with a splash of filtered tap water*

This is from Signatory's lovely **Cask Strength** collection which comes in oddly shaped bottles.  This Clynelish was distilled 9/26/1995, left to rest in cask #8672 refill sherry butt, and bottled as #62/566 on 8/23/2017.  

It is naturally coloured.  From the haze in the glass, I think it's also non-chill filtered?

* **Color:** lemonade / chardonnay
* **Nose:** alcoholic, herbal, some turpenes--actually a lot like the perfume some older lady left in the air of the elevator I took up when I got home from work.  Underneath, some hints of cinnamon, the spicy kind.  With a bit more water, quite creamy.
* **Taste:** fireball until I added more water, then it becomes grassy, with a hint of dry sherry.  In the middle of the tongue, sandalwood.
* **Finish:** short in taste, but mint-spice malingers

I am not an expert on this distillery, but this is not the best dram I've had from them.  The sherry is pretty tired, and the spirit a little too fiesty for 21 years.  I don't find much oak/vanilla influence in this one, and it tastes young.

**Rating: 60/100**
