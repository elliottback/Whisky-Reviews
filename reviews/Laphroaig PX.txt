This will be a quick one... Posting from my mobile in a hotel room in the miserable city of Geneva.

Some details about the bottle:

* First maturation in bourbon casks
* Second maturation is in quarter casks
* Third "subtle" maturation in Pedro Ximinez sherry casks
* 1L
* 48% ABV
* Travel exclusive


And onto the review, tasted neat!

* **Color**: very much like Laphroaig QC, perhaps slightly darker
* **Nose**:  fruity, blackberries, phenolic, peaty
* **Taste**: There is a bit of sherry there, but not as much as I like. The colour gave away it's no sherrybomb. Ground white pepper, lavender, butter, and peat.
* **Finish**: smoke, long, and sensual, sweetness lingers 



While this bottle was fairly cheap, I think around $65 USD, I prefer it less than other Laphroaigs. It has been rounded off by the sherry maturation, but more in a way that dulls the fiery spirit without imparting much sherry characteristic. 


**Rating:** 86/100
