**Bunnahabhain 2008 Signatory Vintage 12 Year / 59.7% / Â£67**

*Tasted neat and with a little bottled water*

I was excited to try [this Bunnahabhain](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/171791/bunnahabhain-2008-sv) 12 year, distilled 12.03.2008, and bottled 15.07.2020 from a first-fill Sherry hogshead.  Mine is bottle 43/275.  

As per usual in the series, this is a nice non-chill-filtered, and also unlike some in the NCF collection, Signatory have bottled this at cask strength which is very nice. 

* **Color:** mahogany (1.6) 
* **Nose:** ocean spray, sherry, cloves, currants; honey and charcoal ash 
* **Taste:** dried figs, blackberries, leather, mint; christmas cake and butterscotch
* **Finish:** long, citrus then sherry and clover

An excellent heavily sherried Bunnahabhain at a fantastic price, I can't recommend this enough.  Interestingly, it's extremely minty with a little water, but there's enough sherry sweetness to compensate.  The sherry is not overpowering, and everything is well-integrated.

**Rating: 91/100**
