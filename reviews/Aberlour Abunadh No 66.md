**Aberlour A'bunadh / 59.2% ABV / Batch #66**

*tasted neat*

Everyone's favourite ex-Oloroso NAS sherry bomb is back with [Batch 66](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/154053/aberlour-abunadh-batch-66); people love it because it's sherried to hell, inexpensive, and cask-strength.  I've been a drinker since the single-digit batches, but I have not been recording reviews since #36, so time for a quick one.

* **Color:** auburn (1.45)
* **Nose:** dry sherry, sofa leather, candied prunes, and pipe smoke  
* **Taste:** intensely oily, thick stewed fruits and figs; honey-glazed slow-cooked ham, anise, some mint
* **Finish:** extremely long, this really sticks with you; sweet and spiced rum

A'bunadh has still got it, and batch 66 hits you right in the face with the perfect sherry bomb.

**Rating: 93/100**
