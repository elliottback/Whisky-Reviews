**Glen Scotia Single Cask 155 / 53.9% / $122**

*Tasted with a bit of filtered water*

I haven't tried Glen Scotia before, so my friend gave me a sample of [their single cask #155 13 year old](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/145774/glen-scotia-2005), which yielded just 138 bottles and was sold at the 2019 Chichibu Whisky Fest.  The distillery seems to have quite the chequered past, with numerous closings, most recently being bought by the Loch Lomond group in 2014 and refurbished.

* **Color:** burnished (1.1)
* **Nose:** a little peaty, hot, american oak, orange peel, aromatic angostura bitters, butter
* **Taste:** very mild, estery, lots of oranges, some smoke, and cream
* **Finish:** a long burnt sugar

This is quite pleasant but simple; I personally wouldn't buy a bottle of it, but it's well constructed and doesn't have any glaring flaws.  I am also pleased they offered it at cask strength, natural colour, no filtering.  I'd definitely go for an older/un-peated/sherried expression in the future.

**Rating: 83/100**
