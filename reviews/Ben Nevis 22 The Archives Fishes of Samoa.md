**Ben Nevis 22 "The Archives" - *Fishes of Samoa* / 53.5% ABV / $220**

*Tasted with a drop of filtered tap water*

[This Ben Nevis](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/131896/ben-nevis-1996-arc) was distilled 08.11.1996 and bottled 10.04.2019 for the *Fishes of Samoa* series by The Archives.  It's a 22 year old matured in a Hogshead #1862 yielding just 202 bottles.  Non-chill filtered and cask strength.

I've been seeing lots of booths from[ Whiskybase's IB label "The Archives"](https://shop.whiskybase.com/us/bottlers/a-c/archives-whisky/) in Asia festivals, and the bottlings are of quite excellent quality.  All of their labels have lovely nature themes -- birds, fishes, etc.

* **Color:** Medium-dark blonde
* **Nose:** Rich, minty lemon cake with nail varnish and leather
* **Taste:** A thick, tarry texture in the mouth; malty almonds, cinnamon spice, oaky muesli, campfire smoke
* **Finish:** Long and oily, beef jerky, lingering slightly tannic

**Rating: 92/100**

This was a real treat and a fantastic companion to reading late in the evening.  I'm looking forward to try more from *The Archives* when I see them in my part of the world!
