**Port Ellen 26 yr - Old Malt Cask / 50%**

*Tasted neat*

The atmosphere is Juicy J and the litany of bottle sitting on my desk nearly done is too high--I've *got* to finish these off!

* **Color:** green-gold
* **Nose:** lagavulin-style peat smoke & iodine, with oaky clover and fruit
* **Taste:** soft, lowland style grapefruit, peat smoke, lavender
* **Finish:** amazingly long, toasted almonds and marshmallow

For a 26 year old scotch, this one feels much younger, but still a tasty dram.  It's incomparable to the OB line--while Douglas Laing & Co have done a great job here, I feel that this should have warranted a special cask.  With just 720 bottles, I was hoping for more.

If you want to try Port Ellen, try an original bottling for best effect.
