**GlenAllachie 10 Year Old Batch 3 / 58.2%**

*Tasted neat, then with a splash of bottled water*

[GlenAllachie 10 Year Old](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/136699/glenallachie-10-year-old) is a limited cask strength vatting of various Billy Walker-inspired first-fill sherry casks.  A small run of just 3,500 bottles, bottled 30/05/2019 it's the classic wood treatment in their standard range but done at cask strength.

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** spanish spicy oak, pine needles, stewed blueberries; with water, still very pine-sappy
* **Taste:** spicy, rich sherry, leather, bacon, maple syrup; some caramel and orange
* **Finish:** long and warm, relaxing sherry and cream

This is just about the perfect meld between cask/spirit, I feel we have both GlenAllachie and Mr. Walker's notorious casking strategy executing here in perfect harmony.  Unlike some of the first-fill wet-single-cask releases, this is extremely harmonious.

**Rating: 90/100**
