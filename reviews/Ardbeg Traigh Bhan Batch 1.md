**Ardbeg Traigh Bhan Batch 1 / 46.2% ABV / $300**

*Tasted neat*

Distilled in 2000 and bottled in 2019, [this 19 year old OB release from Ardbeg](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/131177/ardbeg-traigh-bhan) was exciting news for fans waiting for the return of age-statement whisky besides the standard 10 year old.  It was matured in a vatting of American Oak and Oloroso Sherry Casks, and is labelled as a "small batch" release, but there's no official count on the size of the out-turn.

* **Color:** deep gold (0.8)
* **Nose:** windex, mild peat smoke, lemon spritz, pudding, and lavender
* **Taste:** thin, salty, kelp and campfire; vanilla ice cream, some butyric acid 
* **Finish:** long, with a little oakiness and lingering peat

With its fairly anemic ABV and increasingly high price tag, this was honestly a bit disappointing, but I should have known better.  I'm firmly in the camp that Ardbeg, Laphroaig, and Bruichladdich are three Islay distilleries doing their best work on the short end of aging, while Bunnahabhain can play over the whole spectrum and Caol Ila reall shines in the late 20s to early 30s.

**Rating: 78/100**
