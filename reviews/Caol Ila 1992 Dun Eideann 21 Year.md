**Caol Ila 1992 Dun Eideann 21 Year / 56.2%**

*Tasted neat*

From Genova-based Italian independent bottler [Donato](http://donato-ge.com/whisky.html), this Dun Eideann brand [bottle of Caol Ila](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/88897/caol-ila-1992-de) was distilled in May 1992 and bottled September, 2013 for the Japan market.  It is cask strength, from cask number 8247, and bottle 92 of 279.

The back label describes the brand:

    Dun Eideann is the Gaelic name for Edingburgh, litteraly meaning "The Hill Fort Of Eidin",
    a most ancient fortress.  At its feet was built the city of Edinburgh, historical and 
    cultural heart of Scotland.  The fortress, the very symbol of the Scottish nation has
    been inhabited by the greatest Kings and Queens of Scotland through the century and
    there the highest "Honours Of Scotland" crown sceptre and sword of state has been helously kept
    till our days.  For this reason the name "Dun Eideann" seals the most exclusive selection of 
    rare malt whiskies, carefully chosen for you every year.

* **Color:** burnished (1.1)
* **Nose:** iodine, peat smoke, cream, some oak, turpentine, and musty fall leaves
* **Taste:** rich and warming, cut grass, grapefruit, almonds, vanilla pudding, creamsicle
* **Finish:** very long, some residual sea spray and honey

This is bargain-price Caol Ila that highlights how nicely the spirit does with a little age, and at cask strength.  It's more fiery and Islay-forward than their younger standard 12 year old expression because of its higher ABV, but the longer maturation lets it show some stately age and developed, desserty flavours.  If you like Caol 12 or 18 original bottlings, try getting into some IB Caol Ila.  Caol Ila 12 at cask strength is amazing, and affordable, and young-20s age statements readily available.

It used to be you could buy Caol Ila 28-32 year old from the Signatory Vintage Cask Strength line for $250-$350, but these appear to have dried up (for now) and are quite rare, and priced accordingly.  Until they come back, let's explore some younger Caol Ila!

**Rating: 8/10**
