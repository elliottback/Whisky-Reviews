**Aultmore "Darkness" 22 Year Old / 50.2% / Â£90**

*Tasted neat*

I acquired [this 22 year old Aultmore](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/168004/aultmore-22-year-old-mom) as part of a bundle for a Japanese whisky I wanted more; I usually avoid Master of Malt's house brand "Darkness" for a couple of reasons:

* Pricing is a little high and 500ml bottles are annoying
* The gimmick of using sherry octaves is sometimes good, but in principle, I don't much like trendy cask finishes

Cask #10358/3600, this is bottle #42 of 22 year old Aultmore finished for an unspecified amount of time in an Oloroso Octave.

* **Color:** brown sherry (1.9)
* **Nose:** five spice, molasses, roast plums, banana bread, chlorine
* **Taste:** lots of pear, dried fruits, chocolate cake, cream, and oak
* **Finish:** long, stewed fruits turns to a very strong vanilla

The pear/vanilla notes stand out from similar sherry bomb malts, and make this one a little bit more unique, with more to explore.  The vanilla in the finish is perhaps a bit strong, but also quite tasty, if you don't mind a strong vanilla.

**Rating: 6/10**
