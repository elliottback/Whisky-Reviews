**Imperial 24 Yr 1994 Carn Mor Bequest / 53.0% / $340**

*Tasted with a little filtered water*

This is an Imperial, distilled 28/06/1994 and bottled 07/07/2018, resting in bourbon barrel #5412, one of 161 bottles.

Carn Mor Bequest is the Morrison & Mackay IB label, and it describes itself a bit floridly as:

    BEQUEST (n.)
    LEGACY
    BESTOWAL
    HERITAGE
    INHERITANCE

* **Color:** golden
* **Nose:** grassy; bitter grape skins, dry white wine, orchids, and pine
* **Taste:** lemons and butter, oily mouthfeel, peaches, cream pudding
* **Finish:** medium, with sweetness, and vanilla

This is a decent Imperial, it's super light and floral, and it's got some richness and buttery flavour/texture.  It's also way too expensive for what it is!

**Rating: 85/100**
