**Laphroaig 10 Year Old Cask Strength Batch 12 / 60.1%**

*Tasted neat and with a little bottled water*

[Batch 12 of the Laphroaig 10 year old Cask Strength](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/159190/laphroaig-cask-strength) was bottled on February 7th, 2020 after being aged for 10 years in ex-bourbon wood.  A pretty large vatting, we don't get to know how many bottles were released or anything more!  The back label reads:

> Emphatic, full bodied and utterly unforgettable.  10 Year Old Original Cask Strength Laphroaig is the authentic way to experience the rugged character of our uncompromising Scotch whisky.  It is an Islay single malt that is barrier-filtered only and bottled at natural cask strength.  This gives a depth of genuine tasting and texture normally associated with sampling a whisky at its source.

* **Color:** russet (1.3) 
* **Nose:** tar, campfire smoke, peat, boggy vegetation, iodine, camphor, black pepper and smores
* **Taste:** burning tires, huge smokey peat, honey-roasted pork, sweet jerky, chalk; custard and fruit tarte 
* **Finish:** medium-long, somewhat dry with hints of fruit compote and iron

An excellent Laphroaig, this goes on my top-shelf with their port-finished Cairdeas and the quarter cask.  Preferentially, and this is just my personal opinion, young, cask-strength Laphroaigs are the distilleries strong point; they outshine 20-to-30 year olds.  I love young, fiery Laphroaig!

**Rating: 8/10**
