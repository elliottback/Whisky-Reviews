**Talisker "The Speakeasy" 5 yr / 58.2% / $60**

*Tasted neat*

This is a KLWines cask-strength single-cask edition of 345 bottles of extremely young Talisker, bottled 2013.

* **Color:** bleached straw
* **Nose:** phenolic, burnt plastic, vomiting grass, verdant bilious limes, a tingling nose
* **Taste:** sweating horses, hayseed, hints of treacle; (adding water) lemon-tart, cream, and bitter melon
* **Finish:** burning, quick smokey body blows, unripe bananas, unspecified acidity, (adding water) butter

I gave up halfway through and added water, which improves this--if you have a bottle, it gets significantly better with a little water.

There are a couple interesting things about this:

1. Young Talisker tastes nothing like Talisker 10, it has so many off notes, and is incredibly hot.
1. The quality of spirit between Talisker at 5 years and Kilchoman is significantly different.  Kilchoman is amazing young, and I hope that carries into age.

I would rate this as undrinkable for a scotch, but nonetheless unique.

**Rating: 47/100**
