**Glenfarclas 25 for The Whisky Exchange / 50.5% / Â£125**

*Tasted neat*

[This 25 year old Glenfarclas](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/138049/glenfarclas-25-year-old) was bottled specially for retailer [The Whisky Exchange, and is still in stock](https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/p/48135/glenfarclas-25-year-old-london-edition-twe-exclusive)!

Besides being "matured in oloroso sherry casks for a quarter of a century" and seemingly cask-strength / NCF / natural colour, we know nothing except the tasting notes, which read:

    Nose of leather, espresso and dried mango
    Rich and sherried with fruitcake, walnut oil, cocoa beans and pine wood
    Tbacco and cumin lingers, rounded off with orange peel.  Sophisticated.

* **Color:** chesnut (1.2)
* **Nose:** sherry, candied ginger, musty fall leaves, cracked leather
* **Taste:** sweet pine sap, christmas cake, vanilla, cinnamon buns, five-spice
* **Finish:** medium, somewhat cloying; honey and lavender

This is a nicely vatted 25 year old Glenfarclas; stately, not overly sherried, and delicious.  It avoids many of the problems that plague the inconsistent CS 105 and in many ways reminds of the slightly better Japan-exlusive 21 CS.

**Rating: 87/100**
