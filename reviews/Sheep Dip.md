**Sheep Dig / 40% / $40**

*Tasted neat*

The original [Oldbury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldbury,_West_Midlands) blended malt, woen from 16 different single malts, and bottled at 40% ABV.  The malts are between 8 and 16 years of age.

The name comes from an insectiside that farmers would use on their label, "Sheep Dip," instead of "Scotch," to avoid taxes.

* **Color:** caramel color, halfway between sun and earth
* **Nose:** nail polish, sherry, fresh-baked bread, pine, prunes
* **Taste:** grassy, woody, hints of sweetness, spring herbs, honeysuckle, oak oak oak
* **Finish:** lemon, thin merlot, thin strips of leather, fire

Uncomplicated, light (well, very light at 40%), very oaky, but subtle, unlike the overoakiness of a Dalmore 12.  It is only $40, and I don't review on price, but for the money it's worth a try.  There's less sherry than bourbon here by a long mile, but it's still a pleasant blend.
