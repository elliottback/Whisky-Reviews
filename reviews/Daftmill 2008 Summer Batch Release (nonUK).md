**Daftmill 2008 Summer Batch Release (non UK) / 46% ABV / $170**

*Tasted neat*

Daftmill is a new family-owned, smallish Lowlands distillery in Fife (this [malt-review piece](https://malt-review.com/2018/07/28/daftmill-2006-summer-release/) on an earlier release is quite good!) with a lot of promise, and also a lot of hype.  Bottles tend to be limited to ~4k per batch, and go for around 200GBP on the secondary market, so I was excited to pick one up at Japan retail.

There are apparently two versions of this 11 year old release, [one for the UK](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/142069/daftmill-2008), and one for ... [other markets](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/144359/daftmill-2008)?  Mine is the later.

* **Color:** bleached straw
* **Nose:** grilled yams, chestnut, anise, lilac; surprisingly gassy for 46%
* **Taste:** very clean pastry and apple, oily walnuts, fresh-cut grass
* **Finish:** medium-long, sweets and vanilla, some oak

You know what?  The hype is probably real, this is fucking good whisky for 11 years in Bourbon casks.  Whatever they're doing over at Fife it's working.

**Rating: 90/100**
