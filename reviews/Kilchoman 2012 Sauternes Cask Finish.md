**Kilchoman 2012 Sauternes Cask Finished / 5Yr / 50% ABV**

*Tasted neat*

[This Kilchoman](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/118299/kilchoman-2012) is a vatting of 30 bourbon barrels distilled in 2012, and then married in Sauternes wine casks for five months before bottling in 2018.  The size of the out-turn is 10,000 bottles, and the liner notes read:

> _Nose:_ maritime peat smoke, citrus and tropical fruit with hints of buttery sweetness
> 
> _Palate_: soft creamy chocolate and liquorice with waves of peat smoke, cinnamon and mixed fruit
> 
> _Finish_: layered peat smoke and fruit with lasting honey sweetness

* **Color:** burnished (1.1)
* **Nose:** barnyard, peat smoke, hot asphalt, and caramel
* **Taste:** berries, pineapple, ash, honey, and tannins 
* **Finish:** long, peat smoke, icing sugar 

I don't think Sauternes-finished Islay can go wrong!  This comes out with more sweetness and fruitiness than a regular Kilchoman, and it's delicious!

**Rating: 91/100**
