**Midleton Redbreast 12 Year Old Cask Strength B1/22 / 58.1% ABV / Â£67**

*Tasted neat / with some mineral water*

I previously [was delighted with Midleton's Blue Spot](https://medium.com/p/f7a366e89cc7), while also enjoying the green and gold, so I am excited to report on [Redbreast 12 Year Old Cask Strength](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/217562/redbreast-12-year-old), a single pot still Irish whisky, triple distilled, then aged in ex-bourbon and sherry-seasoned for twelve years, and bottled at cask strength.  The grain profile is slightly different to scotch, as some unmalted barley is also used. 

This is batch B1/22.  The label says it is "untouched" so it is probably non-chill-filtered and natural colour as well.

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** ethanol, grassy pineapple, custard tart, salt spray; tinned herring, jasmine flowers
* **Taste:** fruity and spicy, tropical fruits, strawberry, 5-spice and nutmeg; baked apple pie, ice cream
* **Finish:** long, caramel and vanilla; a little bit of oak

This is delicious, and at the price, absolutely stunning.  It competes very closely with Blue Spot, but I like the slightly younger, punchier Blue just a hint more.  The extra age adds layers of sweet carmel and a little oak to the mix.
