**Dewar's Blended Scotch Whisky 12 Year / 40%**

*Tasted neat*

[Dewar's 12 year old](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/61359/dewars-12-year-old) is a step up from the entry level NAS white-label Dewer's blend, but aside from miscellaneous label statements like "double aged for Extra Smoothness", "Gold & Prize 500 Medals", "Selected oak cask", there is nothing substantive on the label except its age statement.

Other bloggers suggest that there is a substantive Aberfeldy malt component in these bottles, which have been blended and then married for a final 6 months in oak before bottling. 

Also, a cork in contrast to the Ballentine's screwtops.  I am not sure which I prefer, this one is plasticy and synthetic, and I've read that screwtops may offer superior preservation over time...

* **Color:** chestnut (1.2) -- almost certainly caramel coloured
* **Nose:** terps, lilac, salty bacon, and meringue pie
* **Taste:** pine sap, pickled ginger, stewed pears, spice; a dash of cream
* **Finish:** short; some caramel and spice with honey

This is very pleasant but generic.  It would improve if it were bottled at a higher ABV; the marrying process in blending is less useful when you've gone to the rock-bottom of ABVs, so that extra six months finish as a blend does nothing more than really muddy up any potential complexity.

**Rating: 4/10**
