**Hibiki 17 / 43% ABV / 20cl**

*Tasted neat*

I was in Japan/Shanghai the last week, and super busy with the inlaws and touring, but I managed to snag an affordable taste of Hibiki 17 in the airport on my way back out.  Next time I will try to find a local shop, but we were simply too busy!

* **Color:** perfectly gold, as if it was coloured with E150
* **Nose:** floral, citrus, mahogany, hibiscus
* **Taste:** oaky and buttery, orange peel, lemon
* **Finish:** too short, but remarkably flavourful; sugar does not overpower

This is pretty fantastic--and makes me want to buy a bottle of the 21 next time I'm back :D

**Rating: 92/100**
