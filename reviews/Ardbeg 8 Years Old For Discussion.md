**Ardbeg 8 Years Old "For Discussion" / 50.8% / Â¥9,130**

*Tasted neat*

Boasting of some time in "rich sherry casks", the [Ardbeg 8 Year Old "For Discussion"](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/185853/ardbeg-08-year-old), this whisky is labelled non-chill-filtered, but probably not cask-strength.  The front label has a call to action:

    It has been proposed that there is:
    i) An unmistakable smoky Ardbeg intensity
    ii) A strong whiff of charcoal and creosote
    iii) Curious hints of something vegetal, like fennel and celery mixed with woodsmoke...
    DISCUSS!

The back label has some back-patting:

    Point 1.  Congratulations.  With this purchase you've displayed the superior taste so characteristic of Ardbeg Committee Membership.
    Point 2.  As a fully-fledged Ardbeggian, you are hereby requested to encourage others to familiarise themselves with the full-on flavour of the Ultimate Islay Malt - from nose to finish.  In other words, initiate the uninitiated and swell Committee numbers.
    
    Ardbeg Committee Membership Recruitment Formalities
    
    Instruct would-be Committee Members in search of bottlings and bonhomie to take an initiation test (See figure of hug).  With a bottle in one hand, a pineapple in the other and sporting traditional Islay attire, i.e. tweed cap, hogshead cask and wellies, they should recite these words:
    
    "I hereby pledge my allegiance to the Ardbeg Committee with all of my body, soul, and spirit."
    
    After which they are invited to join the Committee at ardbeg.com.

    A.O.B (Another Outstanding Bottling)

This text, besides asking whisky-drinkers to do marketing labour *directly* for gigantic conglomerate LVMH, is also off-puttingly culty.  Whoever wrote the back-text has been drinking their own supply.

* **Color:** amontillado sherry (0.9)
* **Nose:** extremely peaty, a little brine, burning plastic smoke, sugar, sour cream, and sauna pine planks
* **Taste:** overwhelmingly peaty, a touch of earthiness, diluted honey, cardboard and some lilac 
* **Finish:** quick, still peaty with a hint of honey

The ex-sherry casks, however much was used in this, haven't come through at all, and this is essentially just a high-proof blast of peat to the face.  Unfortunately, I can't really recommend this over the standard 10 year old, or Uigeadail.  It's only 8 years old, so it hasn't had time to mellow or develop much.

I will grant that it probably fairly accurately represents the "distillate character" of Ardbeg.

**Rating: 4/10**
