**Akkeshi Blended Whisky Usui (厚岸ブレンデッドウイスキー雨水) / 48% / ¥10,000 ($68 USD)**

*Tasted neat*

The second release in Akkeshi Distillery's "24 Solar Terms" (二十四節気シリーズ) series, [Usui (雨水, Rain-water)](http://akkeshi-distillery.com/brand/products.html#usui) takes more than 50% domestically distilled-in-Hokkaido single-malt whisky aged in Mizunara barrels, and blends it with imported grain whisky which has been aged in a combination of sherry, port, and ex-bourbon barrels.

Bottled in 2021, this is a NAS blended whisky, but probably between 4-5 years old with an out-turn of 15,000 bottles.

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** peat, marzipan, plastic, corn-on-the-cob, maltesers 
* **Taste:** varnish, gummy bears, green tea, pine needle oil, and custard
* **Finish:** medium, caramel on vanilla ice cream, flowers

This doesn't quite hit the mark for me, the way that their 100% single malts do, but it's OK as a blended whisky.  Unfortunately, it uses imported malt, so it cannot strictly be called a blended *Japanese* whisky.  I think in terms of flavour profile, it's a bit of a muddle, unfortunately.

One important thing to note is that Akkeshi is trying for quality; the bottle is significantly heavier/thicker than normal, the enclosure is top-grade, and the imported grain whisky is good.  I am also excited about their gradual transition to using domestically grown barley and peat.

**Rating: 4/10**
