**Amrut Blackadder Raw Cask / 61.8%**

*Tasted neat, then with a drop of water*

[This Amrut](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/105022/amrut-nas-ba) is a bourbon-cask finished, natural colour, non-chill-filtered Amrut distilled in Bengaluru and bottled in September 2017 (cask BA28-2017).  This is bottle 23 of 160; like most Raw Cask offerings it is not filtered and has a TON of sediment, which is their unique point.  We also don't know the age, but it should be between 3-6 years old as Bengaluru offers an accelerated aging environment, similar to Taiwan.

* **Color:** tawny (1.4), redolent with heavy sedimentation
* **Nose:** pineapple, green apple, mango, lemon, vanilla cake; salt 
* **Taste:** creamy and oaky, lemon zest, iced cinnamon buns; milk chocolate, orange
* **Finish:** medium, sweetness with a grassy note

This is a nice ex-bourbon presentation, fairly rich, fruity, but a little muddied and not bright.  It needs a bit more soaring delicacy to be sublime.

A side note, but I love that these are regular arrivals in Japan.  Nice job, Gaiaflow (the importer)!

**Rating: 6/10**
