**Talisker 15 Diageo 2019 Special Release / 57.3% ABV**

*Tasted neat and with a bit of bottled water*

Last year Diageo released a [15 Year Talisker at Cask Strength](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/140078/talisker-15-year-old) as part of their 2019 special releases.  Aside from new bottle design and an age statement, there's little more to go on than an absolutely massive 42,222 bottle outturn.

* **Color:** burnished (1.1)
* **Nose:** huge sea salt, iodine, and peat smoke; tar and butyric acid
* **Taste:** caramel, angel food cake, burnt sugar, and maple-sugar cookies
* **Finish:** earthy peat comes out in the finish, long vanillins 

As with all the Diageo special releases, this is priced higher than we would like, but it delivers a solid, age-statement, cask-strength Talisker.  Compared to the 10 or 18, there's much flavour and feeling of richness, so it justifies the 20-30GBP premium in my opinion.  

Fans of Talisker should not miss out!
