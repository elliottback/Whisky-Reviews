**Ben Nevis 10 / 43% ABV / $45**

*Tasted neat*

This is a new standard release of Ben Nevis at 10 years and normal strength.  It was aged in some kind of Oak, and has recently become widely available in the local stores in Tokyo.

* **Color:** caramel
* **Nose:** light and floral, pears with cinnamon
* **Taste:** quite hot, with butyric acid notes; American milk-chocolate candy bar, butter, and walnuts
* **Finish:** medium and creamy

This is pleasant but fairly forgettable.  I'd buy it again, but it's more "what you would of as Scotch" than a super-unique final product to me.

**Rating: 70/100**
