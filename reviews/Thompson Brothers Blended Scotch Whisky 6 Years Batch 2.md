**Thompson Brothers Blended Scotch Whisky TB/BSW Over 6 Years Old / Batch 2 / 46%**

*Tasted neat*

[This new blended scotch whisky](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/216144/blended-scotch-whisky-06-year-old-pst) from Thompson Brothers (TB/BSW) is a combination of malt and grain scotch whisky aged for "over six years", and my bottle is from their second batch.  It is non-chill-filtered (NCF) and natural colour; they describe the goal of this blend as a traditional, sherry-focused whisky:

> We have selected the components of the whisky to celebrate sherry maturation, and its character is inspired by the sherry-forward blends of the past.
> Once rested, the whisky is slowly diluted to 46% ABV – an excellent balance of easy-drinking quaffability and flavour-forward intensity. It is then bottled without chill-filtration and no colouring is added.

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** spiced wine, sherry, marmalade, cigar smoke, jerky, and sultanas
* **Taste:** more spice and tobacco; christmas cake, custard doughnuts, and tropical fruits
* **Finish:** long, semi-sweet, with plenty of sherry and earthy minerality

A lot of blends fail to be well-integrated, and come forward tone deaf, on one note, but I think this really nails a classic sherry blend.  It's rich, there's oakiness, there's sweetness but not excessively; it has nice hints of smoke and leather.  Overall very relaxing, and for once I think the 46% is just right.  

This is the new sherried blend to beat, especially at 30 pounds (!!).
