**Clynelish 2012 Diageo Special Releases 2022 12 Years Old / 58.5%**

*Tasted neat*

From Diageo's Special Releases for 2022, this [Clynelish 12 Years Old](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/218145/clynelish-12-year-old) is matured in refill American Oak, then finished in Pedro Xim√©nez and Oloroso casks.  The only other fact on the label is that it is "natural cask strength."

I am already not thrilled with Diageo's typical iron curtain regarding what went into this bottle, or if it's been chill-filtered or coloured.  I have the UK bottle so I won't get any clues!

* **Color:** burnished (1.1)
* **Nose:** mead, malty chocolate, blueberry, pine sap, and some waxiness
* **Taste:** first a rich sherry, lemon zest, and tropical fruit salad; then oak and pine sap, a little graham cracker, and chalk
* **Finish:** medium, muddied, fairly woody, ending in a metallic note

Too many cooks spoil the broth?  This is perfectly standard, not exactly living up the Clynelish hype, but I did want to try it.  I'd recommend the Clynelish 14 or Game of Thrones editions over this, but it's not by any means *terrible*.  It needs a little more focus/marriage and less finishing/blending.

I really wish I knew what the out-turn was--probably massive.

**Rating: 5/10**
