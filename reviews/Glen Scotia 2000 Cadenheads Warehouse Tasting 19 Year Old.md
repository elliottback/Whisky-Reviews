**Glen Scotia 2000 Cadenhead's Warehouse Tasting 19 Year Old / 53.6%**

*Tasted neat*

A fairly [unpopular](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/165617/glen-scotia-2000-ca) 19 year-old Glen Scotia from Cadenhead's warehouse tasting, this was distilled in 2000 and bottled at cask strength.  There is absolutely not more information on the label, so we'll have to just dive right in!

* **Color:** brown sherry (1.9)
* **Nose:** molasses, dirty peat, baked bread, paint thinner, iodine, and salt
* **Taste:** dark chocolate, bitter apples, raspberry, licorice, smoke, and medicinal chicory  
* **Finish:** medium, dry, and quite sour

I imagine during the prohibition, you could probably have gotten a physician's note signed for consuming this elixir of health.  While it has lots of unusually medicinal properties, it's also got enough Glen Scotia core to hold it up.  Disappointing, but interesting.

**Rating: 4/10**
