**Glenlivet 2007 Signatory 13 for Whisky Live Paris 2020 / 66.0%**

*Tasted neat, then with bottled water*

[This Glenlivet](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/170611/glenlivet-2007-sv) was a special first fill sherry hogshead #900194 done up for La Maison Du Whisky (LMDW) and the 2020 Whisky Live Paris show.  It was distilled 27/03/2007 and bottled 31/08/2020, but thanks to COVID-19, it didn't make its way to the shelves until a few weeks back.

I was originally interested in this because of the **gorgeous** flag-themed label design, and first-fill sherry cask.

* **Color:** auburn (1.5)
* **Nose:** rich sherry, cloves, leather, cigarette smoke, lemon, and petrichor
* **Taste:** pine sap, chestnuts, barbeque pulled pork, honey, and stewed berries
* **Finish:** long, sweet sandalwood and creosote; citrus peel

This is beautifully done, light and complex, with well married flavours of wood, sherry and spirit.  It's young and punchy but integrated and delicious.  "Some like it hot."

**Rating: 93/100**
