**Arran Port Cask / 50% ABV**

*Tasted neat*

Another port cask finish with a kickier ABV, the Arran hopefully spends a bit more time in the port.

* **Color:** spiderwebs
* **Nose:** floral phenols, soy sauce
* **Taste:** raw, unfinished, smokey (is this slightly peated?), spring leaves, bananas
* **Finish:** nice port comes through, petrichor and cream

At first I wasn't sure I liked this, as it's aggressively young tasting; however, the spirit is absolutely clean, a touch of the portwood softens it, and the overall impression is an aggresive, young dram made softer.

**Rating: 78/100**
