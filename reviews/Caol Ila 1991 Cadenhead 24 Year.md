**Caol Ila 1991 Cadenhead 24 Year / 52.4%**

*Tasted neat*

[This special Cadenhead release](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/85713/caol-ila-1991-ca) of Caol Ila was done for Bar Caol Ila and Japan spirits vendor Shinanoya.  Besides being 24 years old and 52.4%, the label contains no information.  It's almost surely an ex-bourbon hogshead though!

* **Color:** amontillado sherry (1.9)
* **Nose:** sea-spray, peat, salt, lemons, and oil slick
* **Taste:** tropical fruit, pineapple, campfire smores, oily peat, and oak
* **Finish:** medium, slightly sweet, with a little wood, and lots of peat

I think this is a perfect classic exemplar of mid-20-year-old Caol Ila, perfect for a bar with the same namesake.

**Rating: 7/10**
