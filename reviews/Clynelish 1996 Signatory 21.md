**Clynelish 1996 Signatory 21 / 46% ABV / Â£120**

*Tasted neat*

[This Clynelish](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/105099/clynelish-1996-sv) was distilled 18.10.1996 and bottled 23.11.2017, for 21 years maturing in a refill sherry butt #8796.  This is bottle #41, which is natural color and non-chill-filtered, but sadly not Cask Strength.

Despite being only 3 years since bottle date, there is some degradation to the cork, which has stuck to the bottle neck a little bit.

* **Color:** burnished (1.1)
* **Nose:** sherry, strawberries, sugar cane, and molasses 
* **Taste:** waxy and bright, a fruit salad with unpeeled apples, some oak and vanilla 
* **Finish:** medium and fruity

This is a lovely Clynelish with a soft sherry treatment; the refill butt was gentle and hasn't overwhelmed, but instead it's given it a nicely refreshing fruity-berries character.  

**Rating: 90/100**
