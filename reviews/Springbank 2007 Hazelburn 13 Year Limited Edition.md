**Hazelburn 2007 13 Year Old Limited Edition / 48.6%**

*Tasted neat*

[This Hazelburn](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/182388/hazelburn-2007) was distilled at Springbank distillery in June 2007, and is a vatting of 75% ex-bourbon and 25% ex-sherry casks. It was bottled mon 12.04.2021 at 48.6%.  There were 6,300 bottles produced in this batch.

Springbank produces three main kinds of whisky, which I will contrast in a table below:

| |Springbank|Longrow|Hazelburn|
|---|----------|-------|---------|
|Started|1828|1973|1997|
|Drying Method|lightly peated|heavily peated|air dried|
|Distillations|2.5 times|2 times|3 times|
|Production Focus|80%|10%|10%|

* **Color:** old gold (0.6)
* **Nose:** grassy, lime juice, a hint of campfire smoke, meringue
* **Taste:** forest leaves, creamy oak, bacon fat, fruit tarte, and a hint of lime smoke
* **Finish:** medium, barbeque and oakiness, some minerality

This is such a light, summery, and effervescent whisky--it clearly showcases Springbank's quality distillate, and the vatting they've done between sherry and bourbon gives it some meatiness without going into sherry-bomb territory.

**Rating: 7/10**
