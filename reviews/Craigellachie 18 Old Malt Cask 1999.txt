**Craigellachie 18 Old Malt Cask 1999 / 45.9% / $91**

*Tasted neat*

This is one of 91 bottles from sherry butt #HL14846, distilled december 1999 and bottled march 2018 for Hunter Laing & Co's *Old Malt Cask* line of independent bottlings.  It is natural colour, unfiltered, and cask strength.

I bought it on the secondary market, as I've been a fan of OMC for quite a while. This is my first Craigellachie, from reading online it seems like it most of their product ends up in Dewars!

* **Color:** amber
* **Nose:** mint, strawberries, fresh-baked apple pie, hot monsoon rain
* **Taste:** sherry, strawberries, cream and mint, sweet grass, a hint of tropical citrus fruits
* **Finish:** the finish is extremely long and creamy, sugar glaze and a hint of nutmeg

This is pretty uncomplicated; sweet dessert sherry, strawberries, and mint are extremely forward.  I am interested in the ABV on this cask, which at just under 46% at 18 years seems quite low, and a 91 bottle yield is very very low.  There [are not any Laing](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/brand/81414/craigellachie?style=table&bottler_id=&vintage_year=1999&type_id=&itemsforsale=&votes=) 1999 18 yrs, so it's not a split cask... so maybe a spilt cask?

**Rating: 87/100**
