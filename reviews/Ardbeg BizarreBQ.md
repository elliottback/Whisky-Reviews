**Ardbeg BizarreBQ / 50.9%**

*Tasted neat*

After a series of disappointing Committee Members' releases, Ardbeg has droped [BizarreBQ](https://www.ardbeg.com/en-int/ardbeg-bizarrebq-limited-edition-1101413.html) out of the blue, a NAS release aged in double charred oak casks, Pedro Xim√©nez sherry casks and so-called "experimental" BBQ casks.  There is really nothing at all on the label except some BBQy tasting notes and a plug for "Dj BBQ" that I completely ignored.

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** peat smoke, burnt plastic, charcoal, raspberry, bacon fat, and cherry
* **Taste:** charred, grilled BBQ with honey, more berries, burnt sugar, and rich oak
* **Finish:** medium, with iodine and peat up front, settling into a warm, sweet, fruity finish

YES.  Ardbeg has done it.  They've brought something back that has the ultra-charred feel of Alligator, and something fruity and sweet like their Uigeadail.  This is lovely and a rich, welcome return to form.

**Rating: 7/10**
