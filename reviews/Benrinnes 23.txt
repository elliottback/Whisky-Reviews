**Benrinnes 23 / 58.8% ABV / $196**

*Tasted neat*

This Speysider is limited edition of 6,000 bottles distilled in 1985 and released under the Flora & Fauna.  It is, interestingly enough, [triple distilled](http://www.whisky.com/brands/benrinnes_brand.html), and a rare release from Benrinnes, which is usually used primarily in blends.

* **Color:** molasses
* **Nose:** musky cherries, marshmallow, balanced cream, compost, no alcohol
* **Taste:** antique leather, boggy loam and earth, jerky
* **Finish:** massive sherry blast, fresh rasp/black-berries

This is the prize of my open bottles right now, and possibly the best Speyside I've ever tasted--and I've had '69 Aberlour.  This is a rainy-day, fireplace, book-reading, cigar-smoking dram.  Of the three sherried scotches my wife just sampled, this was only one that didn't repulse her (she's a peat-head).  It's got a profile that is more like a big cab sauv wine, rooted in an incredible deep richness.

It's truly unfortunate that Benrinnes doesn't make regular bottlings or distribute to the US, but if you want one, you can buy one [here](http://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/P-10893.aspx).

**Rating: 100/100**
