**Ranger Creek .36 Texas Bourbon Whiskey Batch 29 / 48%**

*Tasted neat*

The [Ranger Creek .36 Texas Bourbon](https://drinkrangercreek.com/whiskey/36-texas-bourbon) is a small-batch bourbon aged in tiny 5-10 gallon casks; the mashbill is 70% Texas corn, 16% rye and 14% barley.

On this bottle we have Batch #29, bottle #554, from Fall 2013, and aged for just 16 months.  It also comes in a half-size 350ml bottle. 

* **Color:** mahogany (1.6) 
* **Nose:** tree sap, orange peel, cardamom, cinnamon, and french toast
* **Taste:** corn, eucalyptus, grand marnier, cinnamon roll and icing
* **Finish:** cloying, mint and herbal

A huge caveat is that I'm not a big bourbon drinker, but I am also not particular fond of this one.  I think it needs more than 1.25 years in the cask, and all this does for me is scream "it's a bourbon!"

**Rating: 65/100**
