**Lagavulin Distiller's Edition / 43% ABV / $105**

*Tasted neat*

This bottle was distilled in 1995, bottled in 2011 (16 years), and double-matured for an unspecified amount of time in [Pedro Xim�nez](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Xim%C3%A9nez) casks.

Folks know I love Lagavulin 12, and wine cask finishes, but this is a bottle I've struggled with before.  It's just not punchy enough for me.  Let's see what another sit down does?

* **Color:** caramel "colour"
* **Nose:** big earthy peat, cr�me br�l�e, burnt hair, menthol--also very hot (alcoholic)
* **Taste:** thin, oily texture; strawberries, iodine, salt
* **Finish:** intense peak smoke follows a brief sweetness

Lagavulin needs to invest in better sherry casks, drop the age on this way down, and perhaps do first-fill sherry to at least have a hope of blending in a bit of bourbon-aged to get the profile right.  The nose and finish are great, but there's no body to this dram!  It's too bland, smooth, and various other adjectives you can pull from my Johnny Walker Blue review.

**Rating: 78/100**
