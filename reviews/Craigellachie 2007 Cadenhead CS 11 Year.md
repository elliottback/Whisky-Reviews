The liner notes read:

    Nose: Millionaire shortcake, green bananas, and muscovado sugar.
    Palate: Paprika, pecans and honey.
    Finish: Died mixed herbs, pears and star anise.

* **Color:** ripe corn (0.4)
* **Nose:** unripe apples, salt water, white wine, and cloves

This is quite a young dram, but it's quite tasty and good value for the money.  The only downsides are it feels a little brash, but sometimes, that's what you want.
