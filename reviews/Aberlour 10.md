**Aberlour 10 Year / 40% / $30**

*Tasted with a bit of bottled mineral water*

I'm a long-time fan of Abunadh, the NAS sherry monster that has evolved over numerous batches, but is always consistently good.  I saw this in my local store, and the price seemed right, so I thought to give it a try.  At 40% (not even 43!) it's a bit wimpy.  

Aged in oak & sherry, 2015 production date.  Almost certainly chill-filtered and coloured.

* **Color:** caramel e150a
* **Nose:** pine wood, cake frosting, lemon zest; ketonic
* **Taste:** some sherry, chocolate, and leather.  Chestnuts; pecan.  Oily moutfeel. 
* **Finish:** long and oaky on the bottom, very sweet

This tastes like "whisky," but as a prototype/artifice, and not as a naturally developed product.  It's OK; it is kindof like Macallan in profile, it ticks the right boxes.  It doesn't do anything to excite or stimulate.

**Rating: 66/100**
