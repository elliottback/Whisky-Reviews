**Lismore "The Legend" 21/ 43% ABV / $100**

*Tasted neat*

This is probably Glenfarclas or Glenrothes, although it doesn't disclose anything about what distillery this came from.  Matured in sherry hogsheads.

* **Color:** lighter than expected, definitely not first-fill sherry; e150
* **Nose:** candy, caramel, toffee, shellac
* **Taste:** grass, bile, marshmellow cake, sherry; alcohol cuts through
* **Finish:** light and oaky, some lingering sweetness

This one reminds me of Dalmore, it's got a bit of the same oak bite around the edges.  It's smoothed out with sherry aging, but present.

Like so many of these fat-top-cork bottles, the cork is not holding up well.  It's starting to crumble noticeably.

Final verdict--pass.  There's too many off notes, and no power.  And it tastes too "hot", this is hangover material.

**Rating: 67/100**
