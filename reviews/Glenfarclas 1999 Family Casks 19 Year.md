*Tasted neat and with a bit of mineral water*

This is a special [Glenfarclas Family Casks](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/140904/glenfarclas-1999) that was released in signed editions during Tokyo Whiskey Fest 2019, and [is still available](https://www.shinanoya-tokyo.jp/shopdetail/000000012001) to purchase in Japan!  Created for Shinanoya Ginza's 25^th Anniversary, it was distilled in 12/2/1999 and left to mature until 6/14/2019 in refill sherry butt #7062, for a whopping 635 bottles.

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** ethanol, mixed nuts, raisins; salty breeze, pine nuts
* **Taste:** very thick, vanilla creme, ma-la spice; honey & beef jerky
* **Finish:** long, shoe-leather and dark chocolate

This is a very tasty sherry bomb; it has to be one of the thickest tasting, most viscous sherried scotches I've ever had.  I love the feel in the mouse; it's oily and lingers forever.

It is almost bone-dry, but that serves to highlight more spiciness.  Considering it goes for just a wee bit more than the Japan-exclusive 21 cask strength, I might consider picking up a whole bottle for myself!

**Rating: 91/100**
