**Signatory Cask Strength Bruichladdich 1990 24 Yr / 56.7% ABV / $200?**

*Tasted neat*

Big lover of the Signatory Cask Strength line, with their weird awkward bottles and tubes.  I'd totally happily pay $20 a bottle less if they could just use normal stock and a paper box....

So today we have the [Bruichladdich 1990 aged 24 years](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/70326/bruichladdich-1990-sv); distilled 26/09/1990 and bottled 11/06/2015 cask no 160 of a sherry butt, bottle 176 of 467.  Natural colour/non-filtered (of course).

* **Color:** dark brown
* **Nose:** pudding, plums and figs, stewed ham, burnt tyres; nosebleed
* **Taste:** wow!  unexpected sweet sherry, campfire smoke, leather and jerky, jelly beans, a hint of cardamom spice
* **Finish:** all sherry, quite nice and long; a bit of pepperiness

This is excellent, and a perfect example of putting Islay whisky in non-bourbon casks.

**Rating: 94/100**
