**Glenburgie 1999 Old Malt Cask 20 Year Old / 59.5%**

*Tasted neat, then a splash of bottled water*
   
This Glenburgie *doesn't have a whiskybase* to link, because it is just one of 227 bottles from refill hogshead HL17284 released through JIS for the Japan market.  It was distilled November 1999 and bottled December 2019, at special cask strength (most of the Old Malt Cask line is 50%).

* **Color:** amontillado (0.9)
* **Nose:** strawberry, rose tea, vanilla wafers; lemongrass and thyme
* **Taste:** pickled ginger, grass milkshake, black pepper; wood varnish and macadamia nuts
* **Finish:** medium, warm toffee and milk tea

This is fantastically grassy, sweet, and afternoon-tea like.  I love the high-proof bottling, and the richness of the spirit.  The distillery characteristic is intensely strong with this refill maturation, and it's lovely.

**Rating: 89/100**
