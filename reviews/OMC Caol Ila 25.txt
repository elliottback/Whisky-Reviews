**Douglas Laing & Co's Old Malt Cask Caol Ila 25 / 50% ABV / $150**

*Tasted neat*

This IB Caol Ila was distilled in 1979, bottled 2005, and aged in ex-bourbon casks.  8 years in the bottle, and I'm sampling the very last drops for a quick review here!  I had [better luck than Josh](http://joshziewhisky.blogspot.com/2012/11/review-68-caol-ila-1979-2005-omc.html), as my cork didn't break ;)

* **Color:** apple juice
* **Nose:** pears, vanilla, cream, smoky malt
* **Taste:** oily, chewy mouthfeel, salty dark chocolate, sea-spray, grapefruit/citrus, some oakiness
* **Finish:** ice cream and leather, cedarwood, cigars; a bit short and metallic

A great bottle that really shows the benefit of buying IB.  To buy the official Caol Ila 25, I'd have [to ship from the UK](http://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/P-12105.aspx), pay $200, and would be getting 700ml of 43% spirit!  I am torn over what numerical score to deliver--one the one hand, it's great whisky, on the other hand, the first time I tried this I was blown away.  Now I'm going through quitting smoking, drinking the last dram, and it's not quite the same.  So my personal situation tempers the score...

**Rating: 92/100**
