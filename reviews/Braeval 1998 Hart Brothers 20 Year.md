**Braeval 1998 Hart Brothers 20 Year Old / 51.8% ABV**

*Tasted neat*

[This Braeval](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/180204/braeval-1998-hb) was distilled in June 1998 and spent 20 years maturing in a first-fill Oloroso Sherry cask before being bottled in September 2018.  A limited edition for the Japan market, this is just one of 300 bottles.  It is cask strength, natural colour, and non-chill filtered. 

* **Color:** russet (1;3)
* **Nose:** green apple, imitation honey, sulphur, and mint
* **Taste:** some sherry, pine, and baked pastry
* **Finish:** long, some sweetness, lemon, and a little bbq pork

This almost tastes like a Chivas blend already, it's a very flat, subtle spirit without a lot going on.  To be fair, the cork is not in great shape, so this may also be a side effect of that--but it's boring.

**Rating: 4/10**
