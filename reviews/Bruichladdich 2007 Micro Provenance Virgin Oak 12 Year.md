[This Bruichladdich](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/147696/bruichladdich-2007) is part of their regular releases of single-cask explorations of various types of grain, oak, and aging, selected by Jim McEwan as interesting examples of the Bruichladdich pedigree.  

This is bottle 255/300, distilled on 12.12.2007 and from Golden Promise Chalice barley, and left in virgin oak cask #3668 for 12 years.

* **Color:** burnt umber (1.7)
* **Nose:** marmalade, peanut, dark chocolate, and sea breeze
* **Taste:** peat, french toast, red wine; creamy milk and coffee  
* **Finish:** long; cotton candy and orange zest

This is an extravagantly rich Bruichladdich, absolutely packed with dense flavours like a triple chocolate cake.  It's very different to their regular offerings, or even something like Octomore--this is peated, but not intensely--and it's been done for a full maturation in oak--so no fancy dessert wine finish to sweeten it up. 

It's nutty and chocolately, like a between-course amusée between Islay and Speyside.  If you find these at retail price, I'd give them a try! 

**Rating: 90/100**
