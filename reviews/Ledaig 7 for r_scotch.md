*Tasted with a drop of bottled water*

This is the one-of-a-kind [/r/scotch 1^st Community Cask](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1yjzd0/rscotch_community_cask_the_result/), a cask-strength, non-chill-filtered, natural coloured, 7 year old, peated sherry cask from Tobermory Distillery.  This is the last drop from bottle 62 of 110!  For a [gigantic image of the label and bottle](http://i.imgur.com/WBi3izd.jpg), check it.

* **Color:** Gold (III) chloride
* **Nose:** varnish, peat smoke, chlorinated burnt plastic, cotten candy, cream sherry
* **Taste:** tar, tyres, prickly pear, honey, mint leaves, vanilla
* **Finish:** sugar, some cinnamon, oak

It's quite an interesting little dram, this one.  Young, fiery, with few of the edges rounded off, but at the same time, powerful and compelling.

I'm hoping reddit makes another one!

**Rating: 81/100**
