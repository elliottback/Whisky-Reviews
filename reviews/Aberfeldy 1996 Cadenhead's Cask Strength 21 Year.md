**Aberfeldy 1996 Cadenhead's Cask Strength 21 Year / 54.6%**

*Tasted neat, then with bottled water*

[This Aberfeldy](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/100976/aberfeldy-1996-ca), from Cadenhead's "Authentic Collection", was distilled in 1996 and bottled from an ex-bourbon hogshead in Fall 2017, at 21 years old.  270 bottles were produced.  Normally, this will end up in Dewars, but since 1999 there is also a core Aberfeldy lineup!

* **Color:** ripe corn (0.4)
* **Nose:** light floral, honey, green grapes, and milk; fresh-cut grass
* **Taste:** grainy, tannic mead and clover, maltesers; lemongrass 
* **Finish:** long, some butyric acid and vanilla

Quite pleasant, and an excellent introduction to this nice light summery whisky.  I will definitely check out future OB bottles when I see them.

**Rating: 86/100**
