**Craigellachie 2006 14 Douglas Laing Old Particular / 52%**

*Tasted neat, and with a bit of bottled water*

[This bottle](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/171958/craigellachie-2006-dl) is one of 309 14 year old Craigellachie's from sherry butt DL14023.  From the "Intensity" series, this is bottled at natural cask strength and claims to give you that "straight from the warehouse" tasting experience.

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** sherry, mildew, lemon, marmelade, and lilac
* **Taste:** richly textured, thick oily, semi-sweet honey; malt, prosciutto, and leather
* **Finish:** citrus and oak; long, with vanilla

This is a big, slightly-dirty, monstrous sherry bomb; anyone with a sensitivity to sulphur may find it too much for them, although many of the offputting notes (burnt plastics, solvents) that one *can* get are not present here.

This goes down deceptively easily.

**Rating: 88/100**
