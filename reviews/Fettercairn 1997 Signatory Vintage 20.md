**Fettercairn 1997 Signatory Vintage 20 / 46.1% / $80**

*Tasted neat*

This is my first Fettercairn, a Highlands distillery, distilled on 10.10.1997 and bottled 04.06.2018, bottle #396 of two hogsheads 5602 + 5606 at 20 years old.  Like all other releases in the Signatory Vintage line, it's NCF and natural colour!

* **Color:** amber
* **Nose:** vegetable oil, winter spices, lychee and honey, and some vanilla
* **Taste:** delightfully rich, strawberries and whipped cream, maple snow taffy, fruit-pastry tart
* **Finish:** long and thick, a little oak and lynchee

This is enormously delicious, fruity, and complex.  I am looking forward to more Fettercairn!
