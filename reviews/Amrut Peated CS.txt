**Amrut Peated CS / 62.8% / ~$100?**

*Tasted with a splash of filtered tapwater*

Amrut is good, but I love it when it is peaty and cask strength.  This is batch 14 from April 2014, not chill-filtered, and straight from the barrel.

* **Color:** light gold
* **Nose:** molasses, sugar, walnut brownies, vanilla
* **Taste:** thick, some peat, burnt steak, pineapple, butyric acid
* **Finish:** quick and salty

This is a scorcher of a whisky--it's peated (not too heavily), it's cask strength, and it's NAS.  I feel it's a bit young, and it's pretty tasty.  Under $100 I'd say buy it.

**Rating: 74/100**
