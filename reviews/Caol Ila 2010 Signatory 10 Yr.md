**Caol Ila 2010 Signatory 10 Yr / 58.9%**

*Tasted neat / with a dash of water*

[This Caol Ila](Caol Ila 2010 Signatory 10 Yr) was distilled on 22/09/2010 and bottled on 20/04/2021 having spent 10 and a half years in Refill Sherry Butt #316650.  This is bottle number 203 out of a large 528.  As with all of Signatory's *Cask Strength* releases, this is non-chill filtered, natural colour, and of course, cask strength.

* **Color:** burnt umber (1.7)
* **Nose:** flat red wine, campfire smoke, sandalwood, and undertones of sulphur; blueberry jam, nail polish
* **Taste:** iodine and peat mix with rich berry cobbler; some marshmallow and toffee
* **Finish:** fruity, lots of peat, and medium in length

Surprisingly dark for a refill ex-sherry cask, I continue to find these 10-12 year old Caol Ila from Signatory's Cask Strength lineup to be excellent value for the money.  This one takes a classic (if younger) Caol Ila to their standard 12 and enfruitens it with this refill sherry cask.

**Rating: 6/10**
