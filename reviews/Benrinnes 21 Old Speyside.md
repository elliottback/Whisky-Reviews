**Benrinnes 21 "Old Speyside" / 50% ABV**

*Tasted neat*

I bought this in Japan but I cannot remember where; it just says on the label it's for The Whiskey Exchange -- let's try it.  Definitely not a single cask, nor cask strength.

* **Color:** muddy puddle of straw
* **Nose:** orchids, pears, and earthy oak
* **Taste:** soft fuzzy icecream (the good airy kind), unripe grape skins, rich cream
* **Finish:** short and unsatisfying

This is a vatting of Benrinnes casks to sell to the market--a solid whisky, but there's not much interesting here to taste.

**Rating: 82/100**
