**Bakery Hill Peated Cask Strength / ~60% / Sample**

*Tasted neat*

This has to be one of /u/UncleTobys 's samples, I have no idea what to expect as it's hard to find any information on what went into making this besides peat.

* **Color:** platinum blonde
* **Nose:** turpines, corn sugar, wet dog, smoke
* **Taste:** bright, peaty, clean spirit; clover
* **Finish:** smoked cotton candy, short

A very enjoyable malt, reminding me of a less aggressive Kilchoman.  The oak is not excessively pronounced or young, and the peating is moderate at best.

**Rating: 89/100**
