**Craigellachie 2006 Edition Spirits 14 Year Old / 53%**

*Tasted neat*

[This 14-year old Craigellachie](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/183940/craigellachie-2006-ed) is one of 290 bottles from Sherry Butt HL18207, laid down in 2006 and bottled in 2021.  It's cask strength, natural colour, and non-chill-filtered.  The label gives some very minor tasting notes:

> A nose of chocolate and berries.  The palate has notes of apples, salted caramel, and biscuit.  The finish is long, with a hint of pepper.

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** sherry-forward, stewed plums, blueberry, milk chocolate, and mint
* **Taste:** spicy tangy barbecued pork, lilac, hibiscus, and macadamia nut
* **Finish:** long and sweet, some candied apple and lemon zest

For a single cask Craigellachie, this comes out above many offerings I've had with substantial flaws, giving you a somewhat-floral, sherry-forward expression that is a delightful winter dram.  Priced around the 100 euro mark, it's quite reasonable.

**Rating: 6/10**
