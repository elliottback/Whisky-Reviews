**Glenlivet 1989 29 Maltbarn Secret Speyside / 49.1% / $150**

*Tasted neat, then with some filtered water*

I tried a bottle of [this "Secret Speyside"](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/124551/speyside-1989-mba) >!Glenlivet!< at Whiskey Fair Takao in Taiwan last December, and it was tasty enough to buy one on the spot!

This was matured for 29 years in a Bourbon cask, distilled 1989, and bottled 2018--just 133 bottles for Maltbarn in Germany.  No chill-filtering, natural colour.

* **Color:** light gold
* **Nose:** fresh, fruity, and floral; lemon meringue, raspberry, and oak-aged pickles
* **Taste:** grassy, hot (without water), oily (with water); mint emerges, with cinnamon and cloves
* **Finish:** long, a creaminess and some walnuts

This is a nice Glenlivet with more of a single-cask characteristic to it, with some really nice light notes, and mint.

**Rating: 85/100**
