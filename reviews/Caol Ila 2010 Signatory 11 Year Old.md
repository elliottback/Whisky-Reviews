**Caol Ila 2010 Signatory 11 Year Old / 58.2% / Â£100**

*Tasted neat*

From "The Un-Chillfiltered Collection", and released exclusively for The Whisky Exchange (TWE), [this Signatory Vintage cask strength Caol Ila](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/201804/caol-ila-2010-sv) was distilled on 9/22/2010 and aged for 11 years in refill sherry cask #316662 before bottling on 9/22/2021.  This is bottle #322 of 558, and initial impressions are a very dark colour from this sherry butt. 

You don't often see young Caol Ila done up in full-term refill-sherry (it's all about brief finishes these days).

* **Color:** old oak (1.8)
* **Nose:** tarry, damp, musty peaty with lots of iodine, salt, dunnage warehouse, sulphur, and berry jam
* **Taste:** minerally peat, fruitness, sulphur creaminess, dark chocolate, a burst of citrus, rye crackers, and stewed berries 
* **Finish:** the finish is long, peat smoke, bandaids, chalk, and some dessert sweetness

This has most of the distillery character I associate with younger Caol Ila dressed in a Sherry bomb, and it is delicious.  It's rich, complex but high-quality distillate and a very peat/Islay forward taste profile as well.  A perfect marriage!

**Rating: 7/10**
