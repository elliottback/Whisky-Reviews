**Laphroaig Cairdeas Port Wood Edition / 2013 / 51.3%**

*Tasted neat & w/bottled water*

This NAS "Laphroaig Friends" special release is a limited edition malt that has been double-matured in bourbon and port casks.

Our friend [Devil juice reviews it on Master of Malt](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/laphroaig/laphroaig-feis-ile-2013-cairdeas-port-wood-edition-whisky/):

> Tastes like Satan's gonads mixed with radiator shavings. A searing hot, throat-clagging monstrosity. Avoid like the plague.

I have higher hopes:

* **Color:** ros√©
* **Nose:** fruity berries (are there any other kind?), humidity, tar and peat smoke, burning rubber that is not aflame more more charring from friction
* **Taste:** flame and smoke on the roof of my mouth, hibiscous farmed on blood, lemon
* **Finish:** creme brulee and menthol

This stuff is just great.  It's the difference between me dressed in jeans and a holey T-shirt with two day's stubble and putting on that sharp gray suit, hand-woven tie with a haircut yesterday after hitting the gym all week.

Port really dresses Laphroaig up, and it's *suave*.

**Rating: 96/100**
