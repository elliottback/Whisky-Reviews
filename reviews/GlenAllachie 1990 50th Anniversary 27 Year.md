**GlenAllachie 1990 50th Anniversary 27 Year/ 44.9%**

*Tasted neat*

[This 500ml bottle](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/110030/glenallachie-1990) celebrates Billy Walker's ambitions to revamp the Glenallachie distillery, following his success at GlenDronach and others, and starts with capitalizing the name mid-word.

This was distilled on 08/05/1990 and bottled in Feburary 2018 from sherry butt 2515, bottle 071 of 156, and is intended to be "a sample of the Glenallachie that was first produced in 1968."

* **Color:** chestnut (1.2)
* **Nose:** rotting forest undergrowth, lemon peel, old wood pilings, grapes
* **Taste:** very rounded, old oak, cigar ash, chocolate bar, pecans, and cream 
* **Finish:** medium, a bit of cardboard, some fruit

This is a very interesting, and quite tasty dram, although the proof is a bit low, it's still cask-strength.  It does have a lot of distillery character, without hiding behind wood.

**Rating: 89/100**
