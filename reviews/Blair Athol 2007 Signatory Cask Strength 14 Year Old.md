**Blair Athol 2007 Signatory Cask Strength 14 Year Old / 53.7%**

*Tasted neat*

Signatory has done up [this Blair Athol](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/210342/blair-athol-2007-sv) from their iconic Cask Strength collection in a 37-month fresh sherry butt finish; previously, this was distilled on 07/09/2007 and then bottled from "Cask No 2" on 09/04/2022.  This is bottle 20 of 685, all natural colour, cask-strength, and non-chill-filtered.

* **Color:** burnt umber (1.7)
* **Nose:** acetone, pine sap, heather, a little sherry and caramel
* **Taste:** piney, oloroso sherry; stewed plums, honey, and vinegar
* **Finish:** long and off; chlorine and ethanol, sour sherry

Quite hot despite the intense, wet Sherry finish.  Ironically reminiscent of a really terrible batch of Glenfarclas 105; anything nice about distillery character is not present here, buried under a mountain of a sherry-nuke.

**Rating: 3/10**
