**Caol Ila 25 / 59.4% / $196**

*Tasted neat*

This is the OB Caol Ila 25 year offering, aged in American/European oak and bottled at cask strength.

* **Color:** dark, no sherry, very clear
* **Nose:** warm smoke, creamy gingerbread, plasticine, ginger, smores, and some peat
* **Taste:** strong mouthfeel, vanilla, earthy peat, charcoal and burnt sugar
* **Finish:** long oaky leather, toffee crunch, almonds, damp ground

There's not much to fault about an OB, CS Caol Ila save perhaps its price.  Like other 25 year lines, Caol Ila has been kicked down to 43% in recent times, so if you come across a bottle of the old cask strength, give it a go!

**Rating: 93/100**

**Caol Ila 32 / 57.1% / $234**

*Tasted neat*

This is a single cask (#HL10083) Caol Ila distilled in 1980 and bottled in September 2013 by Hunt Laing as Sovereign for KLWines.  It's a little old for an Islay, is it any good?

* **Color:** same as the 25, with a slightly reddish hue
* **Nose:** more cream and sugar, honeysuckle infestation, black licorice, some acohol, where'd the peat go?
* **Taste:** oak oak oak.  honey, medicinal herbs, cargo pallet wood frames, peat
* **Finish:** oak, vegetative decay, more licorice, and leather

This is a really fascinating example of what happens when you let whisky sit in the cask too long!  It just ends up tasting like if you still that childhood feeling of licking a tree into a 60% ABV adult beverage.  Go lick some pavement too while you're at it.

**Rating: 72/100**
