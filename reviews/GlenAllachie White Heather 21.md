**GlenAllachie White Heather 21 Year Old / 48% / 150 EUR**

*Tasted neat*

*White Heather* was a discontinued blended malt brand that cask-master Billy Walker decided to revive alongside GlenAllachie.  [This blend](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/179665/white-heather-21-year-old) is allegedly a combination of Speyside (23%), Highland (20%) and Islay (4%) malt with grain whisky (53%).

[A press release](https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2021/03/glenallachie-revives-white-heather-blend/) mentions the cask treatments, which is really "everything under the sun":

> The whiskies spent 18 years in first-fill American barrels, Sherry butts and second-fill barrels and hogsheads.
> The blend, which comprises an ‘unusually high’ single malt content, was then matured for three more years in a selection of Pedro Ximénez puncheons, oloroso puncheons and Appalachian virgin oak casks.

It's nice to see the 21 year old age statement here, as well as the higher 48% strength!  NCF and natural colour.

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** sherry, grapefruit, lemon, five-spice, leather, jerky; a hint of bubble gum
* **Taste:** egg nog, orange peel, white pepper, mulled red wine, and baked pastry
* **Finish:** brief maple syrup gives way to a lingering nutmeg

This is a perfectly bland blended malt; it does *feel* prestigious, malty, and aged; it's well integrated thanks to the last few years the spirits spent marrying, but ultimately, it's not particularly interesting.  There's nothing here that stands out, no note that screams "I love this!"

**Rating: 80/100**
