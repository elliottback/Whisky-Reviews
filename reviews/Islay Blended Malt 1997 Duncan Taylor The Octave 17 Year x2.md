**Islay Blended Malt 1997 Duncan Taylor The Octave 17 Year / 17YR / 52.2% / ~¥12000**

*Tasted neat, then with a bit of bottled water*

A blend from Duncan Taylor, this was 17 years in oak (1997 - 2015) before spending 8 months in an ex-sherry octave.  It's bottled at a hefty cask strength of 52.2%, and this is bottle 44/82 from cask 9810108.

* **Color:** chestnut (1.2)
* **Nose:** iodine, dirty half-combusted peat, cinnamon; cheap brandy
* **Taste:** uncombined sherry and tarry oils, pine; kelp fire and icing
* **Finish:** mead, dirt, and prickling peat; butyric acid

Unlike the previous one of these, which tasted like nicely rounded-off Caol Ila, this cask has to be a heavier peated, rougher Islay; I'm getting Port Charlotte or maybe Bunnahabhain?  The time spent in its sherry Octave has sweetened it up quite a bit, but the spirit is un-integrated and un-finished.   

This is honestly quite hard to drink; it's also got a mealy, coarse mouthfeel that is extremely off-putting.

**Rating: 51/100**
