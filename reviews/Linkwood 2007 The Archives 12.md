**Linkwood 2007 *The Archives* 12 Year Old / 59.5% / â‚¬90**

*Tasted with a bit of bottled spring water*

[This Linkwood](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/138551/linkwood-2007-arc) was bottled by The Archives for their *Fishes of Samoa* series, from Hogshead 805406, one of 280 bottles (my bottle back disagrees with the 262 @ WhiskyBase)!

* **Color:** deep gold (0.8)
* **Nose:** creamy vanilla, lavender, mint, and black liquorish 
* **Taste:** grassy tannins, oak, and toasted pie sheet
* **Finish:** honey and grape soda, long and effervescent

Young and bright; buttery and brassy -- this oaky Linkwood is a delicious summer dram, and should be fairly affordable when buying directly from retailers.

**Rating: 83/100**
