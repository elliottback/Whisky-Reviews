**Lagavulin 12 / 56.5% ABV / 2010 edition / $50**

*tasted neat*

It's friday, and I'm in a great mood for a review of my #1 scotch!

* **Color:** Manilla folder, pale, sun in spring-water
* **Nose:** intense alcohol, scorched rotten fruit, ocean water, lavender
* **Taste:** a big blast of peat smoke, iodine, spiced nori snacks, toasted marshmallow, deep earth
* **Finish:** you've just drank the water of the gods, and feel immortality pulse in your veins

If you open up the photo, you can compare the color of the 12 against the 16 taken against a white backdrop with a bounce-flash which should give you a pretty good picture of the relative difference in color and darkness.  But unlike Macallan believes, colour isn't everything!  The 12 year cask strength has tricks up its sleeve.

This is my favourite scotch, and the only one my wife will drink.  Lagavulin 12 is bottled at cask strength, released in limited editions every year, and every drop is amazing.  You feel your thirst is quenched, the smell of the forest in your nose, as you dip into a stream to quench your thirst--overcast, the cloudy sky will not release your bounty.  Ennervated and sated, you feel the earth inside you.  The elder gods awaken.  Bankai.

**Rating: 98/100**

**Lagavulin 16 / 43% ABV / $70**

*tasted neat*

Now let's step to the older Lagavulin--often mistaken for a better dram:

* **Color:** burnt umber
* **Nose:** sherry, bleach, bananas
* **Taste:** oaky smoke, chocolate, root beer, dilute cola
* **Finish:** lovely, everlasting sweet smoked salmon and cream drizzled with honey, tannins, cigarettes

The incredibly smooth Lagavulin 16 is rich like a cigar club with leather upholstery.  It's the Godfather, but its main selling point appears to be not the quality of the scotch but the number of years on the label.  It lacks the peppery fire of its younger cask-strength cousin, and while the finish is nicer, the flavours as you sip have become muddied, brown.  A respectable dram, and a great Islay that doesn't taste of too much oak or vanilla.

I've thought about this a lot--what if the 16 came in Cask Strength?  It wouldn't help--the 12 is the right scotch for that.  While 46 or 48% would definitely improve the palate, I don't think there's *enough* in this dram to warrant cask strength.  The 21 year old sherry cask, released only once before, is where cask strength would count.  (God help me, I hope to find one...)

**Rating: 87/100**
