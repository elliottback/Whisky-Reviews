**Caol Ila 7 Grand Vin Expressions 2011 / 59.3% / $90**

*Tasted neat / with some filtered water*

This is a Caol Ila 2011, cask #900065, aged for seven years in unspecified casks, and finished in a Margaux Claret cask, also for an unspecified period of time.  I have never tasted Margaux wine before but Google tells me it's a quite expensive Bordeaux domaine.  This was done for Whisk-E, the Japanese bottler.

* **Color:** amber
* **Nose:** intense peat, vicious salt, latex, tannins, a low hint of charcoal smoke
* **Taste:** hot, phenolic young Caol Ila, dry red wine; surprisingly, a creamy center
* **Finish:** volcanic ash and unrelenting peat, underlying notes of raisins

I have hard time for super-young Caol Ila; this cask has just a slightest touch of the cask they put it in.  I wish this was just a pre-release sample, and they finished it for another 5,6 years in the wine cask.

**Rating: 74/100**
