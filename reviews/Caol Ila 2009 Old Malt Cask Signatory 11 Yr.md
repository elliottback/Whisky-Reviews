**Caol Ila 2009 Old Malt Cask Signatory 11 Year / 50%**

*Tasted neat*

[This baby Caol Ila](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/130538/caol-ila-2009-hl), is just 9 years old, being distilled in September 2009, and bottled in February 2019.  One of 385 bottles, it's an unusual Hunter Laing "Old Malt Cask" expression, having been matured in wine cask #HL 15799.

* **Color:** auburn (1.5)
* **Nose:** some campfire smoke, strawberries, a little peat, stewed fruits, orange peel, and nutmeg
* **Taste:** explosive peat, iodine, cinnamon and nutmeg, strawberry, salt, and caramel
* **Finish:** a little bit of the iodine leaves a very sweet, jammy impression with some minerality

The nose is very laid-back and fruity; it's quite understated, and jammy.

In the mouth it's all dessert; rather strange for a Caol Ila, but from the colour this is a pretty wet ex-wine cask, and we get all the fruity red-wine notes coming through, maybe even more than the spirit character which is entirely subdued.

This works better than I thought!

**Rating: 6/10**
