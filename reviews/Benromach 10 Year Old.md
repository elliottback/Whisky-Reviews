**Benromach 10 Year Old / 43%**

*Tasted neat*

Time to take a look at this older-label distillery bottling of [Benromach 10 Year Old](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/56765/benromach-10-year-old), a Speyside scotch whisky aged in "80% Bourbon barrels, 20% Sherry hogsheads with a final year in first fill Oloroso casks" [[source](https://web.archive.org/web/20140701073811/https://www.benromach.com/whiskies/the-classic-benromach/10-years-old)].  This being 43% and part of the core range it is definitely chill-filtered and coloured, although, the new "red" label design has "natural color" on the box.

* **Color:** russet (1.3)
* **Nose:** floral and fruity; apple, pear, a little oak, strawberry, and jasmine
* **Taste:** honey, cocoa powder, caramel, a little oak, and marshmallow
* **Finish:** brief, just a bit of warming sweetness and custard

This is a little simply and inoffensive, but you will be surprised how quickly you see the level on your bottle fall.  For a core-range, non-CS malt, it's solid.

**Rating: 5/10**
