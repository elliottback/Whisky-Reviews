**Macallan Cask Strength / 58.6% ABV / $65**

*tasted neat, then with a bit of filtered water*

* Color: cherrywood, red leather 
* Nose: candied grapes, figs, grapefruit - w/water honey and citrus
* Taste: toffee, leather, fireplace smoke, butterscotch - w/water pepper-spice, jerky
* Finish: amazingly long; maple syrup and a hint of ceder and jelly beans

If you like sweet/sherried scotches, like Aberlour, Glenfiddich, Dalmore, Glenrothes or other Macallans, this may be the canonical example of a perfect sherry-aged scotch.  You can drink it straight out of the bottle, even at ~59% it doesn't burn.  The finish lasts for *minutes*.  The nose is welcoming, rich, and homey, and the flavour will go well with your cigar collection or by themselves.

I don't think I can recommend this more!  OK, here's an analogy:

> Macallan CS -> Angel
> Aberlour Abunad'h -> Fallen Angel
> Ardbeg Uigeadail -> Demon

Bottle notes:

* Macallan is a Highlands distillery
* Matured in Sherry Oak casks sourced from Jerez, Spain
* Bottled at original cask strength
* Non chill-filtered
* No Age Statement (NAS) but believed to be 10-12 years old.  This is reasonable, assuming 1.5/2% evaporation and the spirit went into cask at 70/75%.

PS: Macallan announced that their [10, 12, 15, and cask strength](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/vqn7b/macallan_to_replace_101215_yro_with_nas_scotches/) lines are dead.

**Rating: 96/100**
