**Blackadder Glenfiddich 24 - MYSTERY DRAM / ~48% / $FREE-FITTY**

*Tasted neat, then w/bottled water*

Listening to the Talib Kweli *Attack the Block* mixtape, about to belatedly sample the delicious dram that /u/Scotch_Fanatic sent, I am full of anticipation and wary of guessing completely wrong.

* **Color:** hazy, sunny day
* **Nose:** sweetness, grassy knoll, prunes, salt, iodine, sherry?
* **Taste:** rich, well-balanced leather and strawberries, citrus, becomes plasticky with water
* **Finish:** ice cream, oak, long; pine

Hmm, what could this be.  It seems to be:

* Older, maybe ~16-22 years
* not heavily peated, if at all
* it's either touched sherry very lightly, or it's an older Bowmore

I'm guessing this is a Linkwood, but which one!?

It's got an interesting, prickly mouthfeel.  It's both fresh, but creamy and rich with age.  I'm a bit congested, so if this is peated, forgive me!

I'd definitely buy this, but I suspect it's not widely available in the USA :)
