**Glendronach 12 / 43% / $60?**

*Tasted neat*

This is the post-revival Glendronach 12, dated 2017/07/17, matured in a combination of Pedro-Ximinez (PX) and Oloroso Sherry casks.  As Glendronach shut down in 1996 and re-opened in 2006, the ideal sweet spots for buying Glendronach that's older than the label are:

    12 Year - 2013 - actually 18 years or older
    15 Year - 2016 - actually 21 years or older
    18 year - 2019 - actually 24 years or older
    21 year - 2022 - actually 27 years or older

There is a [diagram on Worlds of Whisky](https://wordsofwhisky.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Grafiek-GlenDronach.pdf) that illustrates the best batch dates for each expression.

* **Color:** russet (1.3)
* **Nose:** mikan oranges, ginger, licorice, marshmallow and campfire
* **Taste:** bright, integrated sherry; mulled spiced wine, cream, lemon sorbet  
* **Finish:** medium, shaved orange peel and tobacco 

Quite a lovely dram--in its budget category, I think it sets the standard for a 12 year sherry.

**Rating: 86/100**
