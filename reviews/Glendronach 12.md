**Glendronach 12 / 43% / $60?**

*Tasted neat*

This is the post-revival 

* **Color:** chestnut (1.25)
* **Nose:** fruitcake, cinnamon, dry sherry, molasses, and beef jerky
* **Taste:** figs, sherry's a bit thin, alcohol is a bit hot, oatmeal, orange peel, some butyric acid  
* **Finish:** medium, spice and tannins, grapes 

A thinner, less integrated version of the old Macallan CS, it's definitely a lot lighter in colour, and hasn't been given enough time in the wood to really develop significant complexity.

**Rating: 83/100**
