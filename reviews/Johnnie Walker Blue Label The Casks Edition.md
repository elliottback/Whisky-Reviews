**Johnnie Walker Blue Label The Casks Edition / 55.8%**

*Tasted neat*

This is a [cask-strength version of Johnnie Walker Blue Label](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/193997/johnnie-walker-blue-label) which I have wanted to try for a long time.  The label tells you nothing except that this is a "A Bold and Robust Special Release".

It comes in a higher ABV than normal, and in a very snazzy 1L bottle with thick glass.

* **Color:** tawyn (1.4)
* **Nose:** musky, heather, alcohol, confused fruit cobbler, lilac? flowers, and peaches
* **Taste:** prickly molasses, honey flowers, a fair bit of smoke, a hint of peat; cloying
* **Finish:** long and sweet, with a heavy grain undertone, lemon zest and sherry

This is OK, but I don't like it.  It's a dialed up mashup of "smoothness", which means it has no particular flavour, and is cloyingly muddied.

**Rating: 3/10**
