**Mortlach 22 "Marriage of Casks" / 54.2% ABV / â‚¬200**

*Tasted with a splash of water*

The Single Malts of Scotland married three hogsheads and 1 sherry butt to make probably ~1200 bottles of this one.  Given the flavour profile and ABV, I suspect it has to be (vatted) cask strength, NCF, NC.

* **Color:** deep brown
* **Nose:** minty grasses, black licorice, vanilla, a crisp breeze
* **Taste:** rich, leathery chocolate, dry sherry, strawberries; the first touch to the palate sparkles
* **Finish:** intensely oily and coating, the tannins start come out, extremely long and sticky.  This has one of the weirdest finishes texturally I've had in a Scotch, in that it sticks around forever.

I think this is my first r/Scotch Mortlach review, but I don't hate it!  I think some of the IB stuff I have tried at festivals that is 20+ years of first-fill sherry comes on a bit too one-dimensional/sherried for me, this is perfectly nice.

**Rating: 90/100**
