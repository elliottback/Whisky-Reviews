**Port Charlotte OLC:01 2010 / 55.1% ABV / Â£90**

*Tasted neat*

The [Port Charlotte OLC:01](https://www.bruichladdich.com/laddie-shop/port-charlotte/port-charlotte-olc-01/) is a young Islay whisky peated to a moderate 40ppm, and aged in 

* 30% 1ST FILL AMERICAN WHISKEY CASKS
* 40% 2ND FILL AMERICAN WHISKEY CASKS
* 25% VIN DOUX NATUREL CASKS
* 5% 2ND FILL SYRAH CASKS

for 8 years before being transferred to first fill Oloroso sherry hogsheads from Fernando de Castilla for 18 months, and then bottled.

This is non-chill-filtered, non-coloured, and diluted to a punchy 55.1% ABV with local Islay spring water.

* **Color:** russet (1.3)
* **Nose:** a little peat smoke, barbeque, vermouth, and bubblegum
* **Taste:** biscuits, bran muffin, vanilla, iodine, sweet merlot wine, berry jam, and pepper
* **Finish:** long, sweety, and syrupy with a wave of salty air and peat smoke

Fantastic, deliciously sweet dessert Islay dram, this one is beautifully integrated for just nine years old.  It's not overpowering sweet, and the distillery Port Charlotte character shines through; the peat is not washed out either.

**Rating: 92/100**
