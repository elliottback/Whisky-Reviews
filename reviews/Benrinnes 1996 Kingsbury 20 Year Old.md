**Benrinnes 1996 Kingsbury 20 Year Old / 56.5%**

*Tasted neat, then with a bit of bottled water*

[A nice 20 Yr Benrinnes](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/110478/benrinnes-1996-kb) distilled in 1996 and laid to rest for 20 years in an ex-bourbon hogshead #11711, 225 bottles were produced.  Tasting notes are "Amber, ginger, complex toffee, agave, sweet, sublime."

* **Color:** deep copper (1.0)
* **Nose:** buttery crisp patisserie, bananas, rum, and hot-house flowers 
* **Taste:** a little oaky, tons of tropical fruits, cream, kiwi, and mint
* **Finish:** medium, warming, some barbeque sauce

This is an interesting one--it's a lot fruitier than most of the barrels of Benrinnes I've had, and the ABV is quite solid.  It's very fresh, and pleasant--I'd call it a summer dram!

**Rating: 89/100**
