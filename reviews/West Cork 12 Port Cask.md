**West Cork 12 Port Cask / 43% / $40?**

*Tasted neat*

I bought this because it was (a) cheap and (b) said **PORT CASK** finished, and thaT's. My. SHIT!!  The label doesn't say much more than it is a "a limited release single malt" aged in "Duoro Superior casks."

* **Color:** light yellow
* **Nose:** 白酒, permanent marker, acetone, grape drank, moldy construction chemicals often smelled in XuHui district Shanghai
* **Taste:** there is some port influence hiding underneath a hot, heavy grainy pot-still spirit, but it's very hard to find; Pruno distilled
* **Finish:** vile; heavy butyric acid, unfortunately long and cloying

I cannot find anything redeeming about West Cork, and I feel totally let down on this cask.  It's so terrible I poured out my dram.

**Rating: 0/100**
