**[Octomore 5.1](http://www.bruichladdich.com/the-whisky/peated-whisky/octomore/octomore-5-1-169-ppm-whisky) / 59.5% ABV / 169 ppm**

*Tasted neat/bottled water*

The 5.1 is simply the latest, slightly peatier version of Octomore.  ABV is a bit lower, perhaps they are stretching to meet demand :P

* **Color:** lighter than 4.1, with really delicate 24k gold refractions, chardonnay
* **Nose:** lighter fluid, more peat, greenhouse brine, floral
* **Taste:** snappily coats your tongue, cloying texture, sticky, s'mores, 
* **Finish:** smoke is literally coming out of my nose, phenol

I think that UT's sample is fresher than my aging bottle of Octomore, and I give it all the stars Octomore deserves.  It's young and punchy.

**Rating: 93/100**
