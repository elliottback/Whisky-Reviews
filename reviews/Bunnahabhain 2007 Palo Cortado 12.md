**Bunnahabhain 12yr Palo Cortado / 55.1%**

*Tasted neat, then with mineral water*

Another [Bunnahabhain Palo Cortado vintage](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/180517/bunnahabhain-2007), straight from Warehouse 9.  12 years old, from cask number 18, this is a nice 55.1% and hopefully an excellent companion to the other vintages I've been enjoying this last year.

* **Color:** mahogany (1.6)
* **Nose:** spice, sandalwood, citrus, dark rum, oak; yeasty bread and chocolate
* **Taste:** raisins, dry sherry, wax, vanilla; with water, pine oil, creosote, and malt
* **Finish:** more spice, medium icing sugar; toffee

This is a lovely dram, but it's not quite as brashly complex as some of the other Palo Cortado matured Bunnies I've had the pleasure to try.

**Rating: 6/10**
