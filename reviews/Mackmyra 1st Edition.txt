**Mackmyra Den Första Utgåvan**

*Mackmyra 1^st Edition / $51 / 1L*

*46.1% ABV, tasted neat then titrated with a few drops of water*

* Color: light yellow, apple juice, withering fall grass (no E150!)
* Nose: sweet rum/caramel, limes/orange, alcohol
* Taste: Vanilla, peaches, with a hint of oak around the edges.  Water brings out more fruit, and a bit too much oak.  Recommend neat.
* Finish: smooth but short finish warms your mouth with light fudge

Mackmyra has a few notes about its process for *Den Första Utgåvan*:

* 45% aged in new 100-litre small casks made from 160 year old Visingsö warship oak
* 55% aged in the standard first-fill bourbon casks
* Stored for aging in the Bodås mine, 50 metres down 

The Mackmyra 1st edition is young: probably three year old. But, this whisky is a smooth dram indeed!  Lacking complexity, it makes up for it with floral / light spring fruity overtones, and a pleasant finish.  The oily mouthfeel and delicate flavours make it stand out to me from the competition--there's none of the rough edges that plague the younger Glenrothes.


**Rating: 88/100**

*Would buy again!*
