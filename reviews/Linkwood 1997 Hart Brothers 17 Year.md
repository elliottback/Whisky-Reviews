*Tasted neat, then with a splash of bottled water*

[This Linkwood](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/80800/linkwood-1997-hb) was distilled in April 1997 and bottled October 2014 at cask strength.  It is most likely ex-refill-bourbon-barrel, and naturally coloured/non-chill filtered.   

* **Color:** old gold (0.6)
* **Nose:** grassy, malty raisins and cream; shikuwasa, nail polish
* **Taste:**  more raisins, oily; vanilla ice cream and toasted bread
* **Finish:** long, lemon meringue and oak

This is a delightful, punchy Linkwood that's not been overoaked, and sold for a dime.  I'd gladly buy something like this again!
