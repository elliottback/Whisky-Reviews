**[Octomore 4.1](http://www.bruichladdich.com/the-whisky/peated-whisky/octomore/octomore-4-1-167-whisky) / 5 yr / 62.5% ABV / 167 ppm / $130**

*Tasted neat/bottled water*

Bruichladdich is onto something with these ultra-peated limited editions, but they're a bit hard to find.  This 70cl bottle of Octomore 4.1 was purchased from TheWhiskyExchange in the UK--you can find the [5.1 here](http://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/P-18266.aspx) for about the same price.  I've seen a few bottles in NYC, but they start at $180.  This review is specifically off-limits to /u/Biomortis, he might die of peatyphylaxis.

* **Color:** bleached hay
* **Nose:** smoked eggs, medicinal iodine, raw sugar
* **Taste:** vanilla, aggressive smoke, ash, pear, salt
* **Finish:** toffee, burny alcohol

For all the hype that this is the world's peatiest scotch, Octomore is more like a dessert wine, incredibly sugary, with a big blast of smoke.  The usual Islay telltales have been transformed by whatever barrels Jim threw this stuff into, and it comes out incredibly aromatic and while not entirely subtle, delicious and just-the-right-amount of overpowering.

I am rating this perhaps higher than I would *objectively* with a few caveats:

* This is just 5 years old
* It's a "concept whisky"
* As a novelty bottle, it's fantastic.  It won't be your everday drink.  Would you eat Crème brûlée for lunch for a week?

**Rating: 91/100**

**[Octomore 5.1](http://www.bruichladdich.com/the-whisky/peated-whisky/octomore/octomore-5-1-169-ppm-whisky) / 59.5% ABV / 169 ppm**

*Tasted neat/bottled water*

Thanks to /u/UncleTobys for a sample of Octomore 5.1, and check out /r/ScotchSwap folks!

The 5.1 is simply the latest, slightly peatier version of Octomore.  ABV is a bit lower, perhaps they are stretching to meet demand :P

* **Color:** lighter than 4.1, with really delicate 24k gold refractions, chardonnay
* **Nose:** lighter fluid, more peat, greenhouse brine, floral
* **Taste:** snappily coats your tongue, cloying texture, sticky, s'mores, 
* **Finish:** smoke is literally coming out of my nose, phenol

I think that UT's sample is fresher than my aging bottle of Octomore, and I give it all the stars Octomore deserves.  It's young and punchy.

**Rating: 93/100**
