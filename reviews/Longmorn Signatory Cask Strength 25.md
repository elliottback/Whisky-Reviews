**Signatory Longmorn 25 CS / 55.3% / ~$140**

*Tasted with a bit of filtered Tokyo tap water*

This is from the Signatory Cask Strength Collection, which come in interesting bottles with a wide brim and rounder shape, and are full of delicious cask-strength whisky.

This one is a Longmorn, distilled 6/1/5/1990 and bottled 9/8/2015, matured in a bourbon hogshead, cask 8615, bottle 17 of 220.  It is natural colour and cask strength.

* **Color:** burnt amber (photo taken in direct sunlight)
* **Nose:** cut grass, alcohol, grapefruit, lemon cookies, burnt sugar
* **Taste:** oaky creme brulee, citrus, lemon zest, vanilla crackers, butyric acid
* **Finish:** ice cream, turned earth

This is a tasty bourbon-cask Longmorn, but the extra age in bourbon doesn't seem to do much for Longmorn; I'd much prefer some time in sherry. There's also a little bit of an off-character in the tasting note on the bite.

**Rating: 88/100**
