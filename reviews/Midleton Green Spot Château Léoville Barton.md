**Midleton Green Spot Château Léoville Barton / 46% ABV**

*Tasted neat*

There is a little bit of a story to [this Green Spot single pot still Irish Whisky](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/68938/green-spot-chteau-loville-barton); normal Green Spot is an Irish Whisky triple-distilled at Midleton Distillery and aged for seven to ten years in ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks.

For this version, they've added a 12-24 month wine-cask finish, using French oak from Château Léoville Barton, Saint Julien.   The out-turn is 4000 bottles, and at diluted strength; no information on natural colouring, almost certainly filtered.  

Let's see how Mitchell & Son's (Est'd 1805) fine Irish spirits are like.

* **Color:** russet (1.3)
* **Nose:** ethanol, raspberry, corn, rose, black pepper, a little fudge, vanilla
* **Taste:** full custard, fresh strawberry, whipped cream, fresh bread, and dry spices
* **Finish:** medium; slightly acidic, pastry and sparkling mineral water

There's something a bit grainy on the nose, it's got a certain amount of hot alcohol with perfumey fruits underneath.  The French Oak influence must have added a good deal of dry fruitiness, which is both good (because we have new notes to enjoy) and bad (because it steers towards the drier side).

I would drink this again, but probably not at the premium it goes for in Japan.
