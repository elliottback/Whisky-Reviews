**Benrinnes SMWS 36.134 "Silky, Citrus Purr-suation" / 55.8% ABV / $120?**

*Tasted with a splash of mineral water*

I bought [this bottle](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/108662/benrinnes-2002-smws-36134) in Taiwan, a first fill ex-bourbon cask 14 year old, 2002 vintage, and one of 189 bottles, because it was a Benrinnes, and I've started to like some of the SMWS bottlings.

SMWS label notes:

    the nose evokes marzipan, vanilla, primroses, and yellow fruits, then hints of tobacco.  The palate has silky sweet fruits and tongue-tingling heat.

* **Color:** sunset
* **Nose:** alcohol, musty grape fungus, gingerbread icing
* **Taste:** vanilla up front, phenolic and a bit hot; it doesn't open up, but you get a bit of oak, and some pineapple
* **Finish:** short, with a lot of sweetness; there's a bit of spice on the end and a sense of butyric acid

This is a bit of a challenging bottle--it's not bad, but it probably should have sat in its cask for a few more years.  It lacks the classic Benrinnes profile I enjoy, and the spirit feels feisty still for aging.

**Rating: 78/100**
