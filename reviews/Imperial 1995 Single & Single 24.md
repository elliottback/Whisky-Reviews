**Imperial 24yr 1995 - Single & Single / 49.2% ABV**

*Tasted neat*

This is bottle 97 of 204 ex-bourbon, cask strength, [Imperial from Single & Single](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/155008/imperial-1995-ss), an unusually small IB with just a handful of releases.  I had not heard of them before, but [they](https://singleandsinglewhisky.com/our-story/) appear to be a creation of [Walking Back the Cat Limited](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/11593224), a small company with a name inspired by a [Robert Littell](https://www.amazon.com/Robert-Littell/e/B000APIOAS/) spy novel.

* **Color:** amontillado sherry (0.9)
* **Nose:** custard, vanilla ice cream, hydrangeas, lemon-mint tea
* **Taste:** floral, grassy vanilla, creamy oak, a touch of strawberry tart, earl-grey tea
* **Finish:** lots more oak, long and sweet, baked pie

This is a brilliant Imperial, it's got the loveliest mouthfeel and creaminess!

**Rating: 90/100**
