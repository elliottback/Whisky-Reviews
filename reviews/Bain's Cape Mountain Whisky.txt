> The [Master of Malt Whisky Advent Calendar](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/drinks-by-the-dram/the-whisky-advent-calendar/) is a $250 box with 24x30ml samples of whisky, including a 50 year old scotch!  To facilitate tasting these little sample, and avoid oversharing, I'll be compiling mine in blocks of 5 and posting them here in an abbreviated format!  Please check out days [1 through 5](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/14d9m2/whiskymas_reviews_days_1_to_5/) and [6 - 10](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/14nd69/whiskymas_reviews_days_6_10/).

**Day 12: [Bain's Cape Mountain Whisky](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/james-sedgewick-distillery/bains-cape-mountain-whisky/?srh=1)**
*43% ABV*

South African single-grain whisky, made with local Cape Mountains water.

* **Color:** caramel colouring
* **Nose:** coconut, floral honey, alcohol
* **Taste:** toffee, syrup, and rounded oak
* **Finish:** coconut, minerality, rich cream

No age statement here, but this is a smooth sipping-on-ice sort of whisky that goes down like a pi√±a colada.  It's inoffensive, and while I'd never buy it, I've had far worse Canadians.

**Rating: 58/100**
