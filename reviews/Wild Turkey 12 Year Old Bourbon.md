**Wild Turkey 12 Year Old Bourbon (2022 edition) / 50.5% / ¥6,580 (about $50 USD)**

*Tasted neat*

From the late 1980s, Wild Turkey released a special 12 year old distiller’s reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon for the Japan/Asia market, but that was discontinued in 2012.  Now, as of 2022 it's back!  This is great news, because the stopgap product, the 13 year old, was quite a bit more expensive and at a lower ABV.

[Wild Turkey 12 Year Old](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/212277/wild-turkey-12-year-old), 2022+ edition, is being sold in South Korea, Japan, and Australia, and has a mashbill of 75% corn, 13% rye, and 12% barley.  It is aged for at least 12 years in virgin American oak.

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** candy, pine sap, mint, vanilla, tobacco, sawdust and cherry
* **Taste:** cherry cough syrup, creme de menthe, oak, dark chocolate, and candied orange
* **Finish:** pretty long, with some herbality, cut grass, pop tarts, and strawberries

I am not a big drinker of bourbons but this is highly approachable and quite delicious, with lovely complexity.  While I can get my hands on it, this is going to be staple "bourbon of choice".

If you are in Japan and want to buy this, stock is drying up a bit, but there are some priced a little more as MSRP was now raised to 8,800 (about $60 USD) at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%83%AF%E3%82%A4%E3%83%AB%E3%83%89%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC%E3%82%AD%E3%83%BC-700ml-%E3%82%A6%E3%82%A3%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AD%E3%83%BC-WILD-TURKEY/dp/B0B9WTX76G).
