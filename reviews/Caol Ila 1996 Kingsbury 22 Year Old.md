**Caol Ila 1996 Kingsbury 22 Year Old / 55.3%**

*Tasted neat, then with bottled water*

[This Caol Ila](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/170026/caol-ila-1996-kb) was distilled in 1996, laid into sherry butt cask #795, where it rested for 22 years before giving 191 bottles.  The tasting notes on the label read "Copper, ember, oily, bacon, maple, unending, iconic."

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** iodine and seaweed, peat smoke, burnt caramel, black licorice, and dank fall leaves
* **Taste:** rich sherry, oily apple and peach cobbler, asphalt, pulled pork, and acetone
* **Finish:** long, still intensely peaty, barbeque smoke, and salt spray

You don't often see rough, rumbly 20-year old Caol Ilas from ex-Sherry butts.  This walks the fine line of retaining Caol Ila character while adding in some considerable sweetness from the sherry butt.  What's missing is a fealing of *age*, because of the bigger surface area / maybe refill wood, this tastes more like a 12-year old Caol Ila with sherry.

[The Whisky Roundabout](https://www.thewhiskyroundabout.com/products/3360-caol-ila-1996--22-year-old--kingsbury/) has a bottle for 420 euroes.

**Rating: 6/10**
