**Ben Nevis 2008 BlackAdder 14 Year Old / 62.2%**

*Tasted neat*

Bottled under the Ingelred series ("Whisky with an edge"), [this Ben Nevis](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/217976/ben-nevis-2008-ba) was distilled in January 2008, laid to rest for 14 years in cask #186, a first-fill ex-bourbon, and bottled in April 2022.  This is bottle 71 of 215.

[Ingelred](https://ingelred.com/) is a new Swedish whisky brand that has partnered with BlackAdder, and have fully adopted viking branding, naming themselves after [a group of famous medieval swords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingelrii).  The packaging and green/red colouring are classy and unostentatious; as long as they can resist jumping the shark Highland Park-style, I think they will do OK!

* **Color:** burnished (1.1)
* **Nose:** huge, meaty nose, lots of oak, fruit salad, buttery baked bread and moss
* **Taste:** tropical fruit; guava, a little pineapple, roasted apples, lemon tart, rich oak, and spice
* **Finish:** long, oaky, with more baked fruit and pastry

An absolute banger of a Ben Nevis, I can't believe this is still somewhat available.  This perfectly balances out the right amount of oakiness to turn what could be an astringent, fresh-sliced fruit into a roasted, redolent dessert of a whisky.

**Rating: 8/10**
