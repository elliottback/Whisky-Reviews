**Clynelish 1993 Silver Seal 22 / 51.7% ABV / ¥87,458**

*Tasted neat and with bottled water*

I was very excited when the magnum-sized version (1.5 liters) of [this Silver Seal Clynelish](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/84720/clynelish-1993-ss) showed up on Yahoo Auctions Japan, because it is one of just 15 bottles of this size.  And of course, it's 1500ml of Clynelish.

This one is distilled 1993, and bottled in 2016 at 51.7%, from cask #7562, bottle number 8 of 15.  It is most likely cask strength and non-chill-filtered, and was imported to Japan by ePower.

It looks like people are not drinking these (oops!) and you can still buy it from [Hedonism](https://hedonism.co.uk/product/clynelish-22yo-bottle-1-15-magnum-1993) for 1500 GBP.  There's also [four bottles of the non-magnum size](https://mukawa-spirit.com/?pid=107678707) on offer for ¥56,600 in Japan. 

* **Color:** old gold (0.6)
* **Nose:** chestnuts, musty room, lemons, muscat; apple skin and crab boil
* **Taste:** sweet tangy barbeque sauce, mikan, thick waxiness; limeade with mint
* **Finish:** medium, citrus and herbs; custard

This is a beautiful older waxy Clynelish with a classic waxiness and citrus.  The mouth-feel is intensely oily and rich; it's ridiculously drinkable, abeit, pricey.

**Rating: 93/100**
