**Loch Lomond "Original Collection" Cadenhead 17 Year Old / 46.0%**

*Tasted neat*

[This Loch Lomond](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/214683/loch-lomond-17-year-old-ca) is 17 years old, non-chill filtered, natural colour, and matured in oak casks -- although clearly sherry oak casks.  In a sad departure from previous excellence, and in a bit to fight the powers of inflation, Cadenhead's has decided to kill of their beloved "small batch" cask strength line and so this is at 46% with minimal disclosure.

Some fun facts about Loch Lomond distillery, in the Highlands:

* They produce some different 8 kinds of whisky
* Their pot still have long coffey-esque columns
* The former owner of Littlemill Distillery, Duncan Barton, developed the current site

On to the review:

* **Color:** old oak (1.8)
* **Nose:** cola, oloroso sherry, raisins, strawberry jam, figs, and baked bread
* **Taste:** tobacco, california cabernet sauvignon, honey, cherry; a little spearmint
* **Finish:** medium, a little herbal and drier towards the end

This is pretty lovely, delicate sherry work here.  Imagine what it would have been like in full-cask-strength glory?

**Rating: 6/10**
