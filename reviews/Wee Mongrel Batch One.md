**Wee Mongrel 20 Year Batch One / 52.3% / Â£49**

*Tasted neat*

Although it is just 50cl, [this massive 850 bottle release](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/178747/blended-malt-scotch-whisky-20-year-old-lbds) excited me because it is a blend with (a) an age statement (20 years!) and (b) cask strength!  Wee Mongrel Batch One was married in a single sherry butt, so it's also technically a single cask malt whiskey!

* **Color:** tawny (1.4)
* **Nose:** toffee, bubble gum, pine, and creamy sherry
* **Taste:** lots of stewed pears, plums, and berries; mint, tobacco smoke, sherry, and leather
* **Finish:** medium, full bodied; vanilla ice cream

This little blend has quite the bang for the buck, and I'd buy it again easily.  It's classy, complex (enough), and a perfect restrained example of a good sherry cask treatment.

**Rating: 86/100**
