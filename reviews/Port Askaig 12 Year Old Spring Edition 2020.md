**Port Askaig 12 Year Old Spring Edition 2020 / 45.8%**

*Tasted neat*

A limited edition of 5,000 bottles, this un-named Islay branded [Port Askaig 12 Year Old Spring Edition 2020](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/158096/port-askaig-12-year-old-eld) was a vatting of 18 ex-bourbon hogsheads from two vintages (2006 & 2007).  Not cask strength, but it is natural colour and non-chill-filtered.

On the front, we have:

> The spirit of Islay awakens. Overhead, migrating birds leave these green shores as the lengthening days and rays of amber light foresee the warmth of summer.

The back has some additional text hinting at the distillery who made this:

> ... from a distillery on the north-east coast of Islay, close to the village of Port Askaig.

* **Color:** pale gold (0.3)
* **Nose:** kelp, iodine, salt spray, creosote, kerosene, peat smoke
* **Taste:** more iodine, whipped cream and pastry, lemon zest, and peat smoke
* **Finish:** medium: slightly oaky, sweet, with less of the dirtier peat on the nose; creaminess increases over time

This is of course a very lovely, affordable (and arguably better than the OB) expression of Caol Ila 12 year.  If it were cask strength, it would be perfect!

**Rating: 6/10**
