**1981 Noh Karuizawa 31 Yr / 62.3% / $389.99**

*Tasted with a drop of water, and [Superfly](http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfly)*

This Karuizawa K&L Exclusive single-barrel cask-strength is 31 years old, distilled 1981, bottled 2013, and aged in a Sherry butt in cask #8775 with a final bottle count of 196, and bottled at 62.3%.  The distillery in the Japanese alps started production in 1956 and shuttered in 2000, so once again I am extremely excited to try a whisky that will never be made again!

* **Color:** extremely deep hued; red mahogany
* **Nose:** big sherry, raisins and fruitcake, cream, petrichor
* **Taste:** pine, pepper, lemons, spice, siracha, juniper, a tingle of alcohol, high-palate woods
* **Finish:** extremely long, leather, antiseptics, grass, cider, jelly beans

This whisky is confusing; simulataneously super-hot, yet beautifully well rounded.  It's the closest scotch I've tasted to a quality bourbon, but it's still identifyable as a scotch-style whisky.  I don't know what to think, except lament that it doesn't exist anymore.

**Rating: 92/100**
