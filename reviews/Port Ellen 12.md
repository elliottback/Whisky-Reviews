**Port Ellen 12 / 32 Year**

*52.5% ABV / $500*

Bottled from refill American/European oak casks filled in 1979, a good five years before my birth, we're tasting a tiny droplet of Port Ellen 12th release, the 32 year old bottling from Diageo.  The price is shocking, but the distillery is defunct, and will never produce any more scotch.  So is this just a collect-it-because of its increasing rarity dram?  Or is there something truly special here, lost for all time--we'll see.

* **Color:** blood gold
* **Nose:** vanilla, oak, sugar, honey and butterscotch
* **Taste:** liquorice, dank earth, fungal peat, and moist floral honey
* **Finish:** paralysis grips your tongue as sweet oak rolls in with smores

This is the embrace of the queen of a hive that has lasted for thousands of years, storing up honey from flowers long exctinct, a brief embrace that leaves you breathless and dreaming of simpler times.  It's an Islay, but one tempered by age so far it's almost speyside.  It's incredibly earthy and round.  

I think Port Ellen between the 9th and 12th releases has passed the inflection point at which the earthiness of the oak aging detriments the whisky.  The 9th edition is still fiery and young, the 10/11th editions are stateful, and the 12th edition is full and mature.  Going forward, we may not see a better vatting.

**Rating: 93/100**
