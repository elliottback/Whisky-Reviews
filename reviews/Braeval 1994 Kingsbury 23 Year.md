**Braeval 1994 Kingsbury 23 Year / 54.1% ABV**

*Tasted neat, then with some mineral water*

[Braeval, formerly known as The Braes of Glenlivet](https://scotchwhisky.com/whiskypedia/1826/braeval/), is a bit of an odd Speyside distillery, mothballed in 2001 and reopened in 2008 by Pernod Ricard for Chivas.  It produces 4mm litres a year.

[This single cask](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/127898/braes-of-glenlivet-1994-kb) is barrel #165588, distilled in 1994 and bottled in 2017 for 23 years in the cask.  It yielded 182 bottles, and comes with these tasting notes:

    Golden, floral, soft.  
    Pear, barley, cleansing.  
    Enchanting.

* **Color:** deep gold (0.8)
* **Nose:** creamy, astringent, malty, honeysuckle; whole-grain bread, fresh paint  
* **Taste:** oak, asian pear, honey; rosewater, white grape, and gummy candies
* **Finish:** long and sweet, fruit custard and bubble gum 

Not a huge amount of Braeval is floating around, and they offer ~~no~~ very few original bottlings of their own, so this is a bit of a strange treat.  It's very floral and strong, well-developed, and moderately complex.  Prior to this bottle, I had only tried a 10-12 year trade sample from a sherry butt, but I found the distillery character interesting and bought this one.

**Rating: 89/100**
