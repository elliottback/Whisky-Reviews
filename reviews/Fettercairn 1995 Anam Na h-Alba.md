**Fettercairn 1995 "Anam na h-Alba" / 58.3% / Â£51.70**

*Tasted with a bit of mineral water*

[An odd Fettercairn](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/67629/fettercairn-1995-anha), this was bottled for [Anam na h-Alba](https://shop.anamnahalba.com/Anam-na-h-Alba), a small German boutique whiskey shop with a fairly impressive turn-out of IB single casks (15 on offer right now).

This is bottle #16 of 250, bottled at cask strength, natural colour, no chill filtration.  It is believed to be 19 years old, but it's not stated on the label.

* **Color:** burnished-ish (1.05)
* **Nose:** rubbing alcohol, canned peaches, mint, candy corn
* **Taste:** oily, thick on the tongue, mint, strawberries, and cream; malty    
* **Finish:** quite long with honeycomb and salt

There is a little bit of a cardboardy off-note towards the mid-end, but otherwise stellar.

This is an excellent IB, especially at the price it went for (bought at auction).  I am also a big fan of Fettercairn's fruity and rich flavour profile and look forward to trying more in the future!

**Rating: 89/100**
