**Imperial 1998 Gordon & Macphail 11 Year Old / 42%**

*Tasted neat*

Bottled for Amer Gourmet in Spain, [this Gordon & Macphail Imperial](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/86419/imperial-1998-gm) was distilled on 9/9/1998, possibly just a month before its closure, and bottled on 6/14/2010 from refill sherry hogshead #1223.  This is bottle #90 of 378, and it is natural colour and un-chill-filtered (NCF).

* **Color:** yellow gold (0.5)
* **Nose:** wet grass, whipped cream, almonds, lemon, and fresh asphalt 
* **Taste:** thin, quite green, a little hot; there is a dollop of sour cream and some oak, lime, and Oloroso sherry
* **Finish:** medium; graham crackers, creaminess, and some citrus

There are a few points not in favour for this particular bottle:

* It is a special run for a regional Supermarket
* It's nowhere near cask strength
* It's quite young in refill sherry
* The last few years of Imperial before it collapsed have a notable falloff in quality

That said, it has enough distillate-forward spirit remaining to give you some kind of a clue as to what Imperial was about, even if it lacks the richness it could have obtained with another decade and cask-strength.

**Rating: 4/10**

PS: If you can find the exact date of the last distillation batch of Imperial liquid, let me know in the comments!  I found 10/2/1998 (MM/DD/YYYY) on Whiskybase.
