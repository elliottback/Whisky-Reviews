**Clynelish Reserve - House Tyrell / 51.2%**

*Tasted neat*

The Game of Thrones tie-in whiskies have been broadly panned in the press, but as a Clynelish fan, let's give this [Clynelish Reserve - House Tyrell](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/118410/clynelish-reserve-house-tyrell) a try.  The only thing we know about it is that's it bottled at a cask-strength-like 51.2% ABV; the rest is NAS and not labelled.  It may be chill-filtered, coloured artificially, and diluted to 51.2%.

* **Color:** burnished (1.1)
* **Nose:** candlewax, sliced apple, unripe pear, honey, lemon spritz
* **Taste:** funky waxy classic Clynelish profile, some vanilla, jasmine, and winter spices
* **Finish:** medium, bright; lemon meringue pie 

Two things spring to mind:

* This is probably caramel coloured
* Beware: it takes water extremely poorly

This turned out to be better than I expected, but it's noticeably younger, hotter, and more expensive than the 14 year regular bottling.  Still, if you like Clyenlish, you probably won't hate this one.

**Rating: 81/100**
